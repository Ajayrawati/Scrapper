Something you can&apos;t say about Germany films in general.  The story takes place in Mexico in the strange and deserted village Campo del Sol.  Mexican war hero Don Jose (G\u00f6tz &quot;is-he-sexy&quot; Otto)takes his just married wife home to meet the family - but there is none.  Only strange people, like the major (Elisabeth Volkmann) who swares and sings all the time and is married to an indian (Goiko Mitic) - what a great casting!  On the other side of the street lives a totally luny man, who turns out to be a mexican super bad guy.  A man who wants to cross ants with humans - and he picks the heros wife.  Does it sound like the plot to a B Movie.  It sure is, but one with a lot of fun and singing.  This is new in German cinema - we need more of that.  Sit back and enjoy the antman and sing along.",

I wanted more actually, because the CGI was really good. Also this is one of the funniest mcu movies, so if you want a good laugh I recommend this. \n\nI applaud Paul Rudd and Micheal Douglas, great performance! \n\nIf you&apos;re a marvel fan this will satisfy you 100% and even if you just want to relax and enjoy this movie with the family, that&apos;s cool too. \n\nIt&apos;s kind off not really tied to the rest of the mcu, just as the first one, only captain America civil war a bit.

Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd&apos;s character less important. You don&apos;t feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don&apos;t even know what happened to them after previous movie. It&apos;s hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it.",
