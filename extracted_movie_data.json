            "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.\n\nI have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.\n\nNot everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.\n\nSomething that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.\n\nFor me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.\n\nBrilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.",

What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.\n\nThe writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.",

            "reviewBody": "I could go on, but I thought I&apos;d stop there before my summary line gets too big. Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I&apos;ll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn&apos;t it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.\n\nBut back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn&apos;t yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.\n\nNow that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I&apos;m not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you&apos;re inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened. Even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so.\n\nThere are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and I&apos;m sure there quite a few sources online to look for. Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. But again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so. It does not mean you are wrong and it surely does not mean that this movie is falsely considered a masterpiece!",

            "reviewBody": "Obviously, I&apos;m aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that&apos;s how I&apos;m judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.\n\nAt this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.\n\nThis is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it&apos;s all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.\n\nThese were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I&apos;m one of them.\n\nSorry if I&apos;m being all fanboyish and kissing this movie&apos;s ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that&apos;s a bit depressing.\n\nMy rating: 10/10",

Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler&apos;s List did. Schindler&apos;s List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler&apos;s List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler&apos;s List. Me n my kids cried during the pit scene.",

Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.",

To my surprise, it did not disappoint.\n\nNow, several years later after having watched all three of these &quot;Rings&quot; films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies&apos; long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the &quot;Fellowship&quot; film.\n\nAnyway, &quot;Fellowship,&quot; stunned me for the visuals alone. I can&apos;t recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don&apos;t care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.\n\nThe story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It&apos;s an incredible movie experience.",

            "reviewBody": "A sprawling Western epic that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold, Sergio Leone&apos;s `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&apos; is a masterpiece, one that continues to get better and better with each viewing.  In a way, it&apos;s a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner.  Sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. This film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne `White Hat/Black Hat&apos; Western.\n\nThe three main characters make the film.  Lee Van Cleef (`The Bad&apos;) is evil personified.  Totally ruthless, he&apos;ll do whatever it takes to get what he wants.  Clint Eastwood (`The Good&apos;) is the Man With No Name, not really `good&apos; in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing.  (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.)  Eli Wallach (`The Ugly&apos;) is Tuco, and he&apos;s easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film.  All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood&apos;s best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents `the ugly&apos; side of people.\n\nThe movie is long, but there&apos;s not a wasted scene in the film.  Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what&apos;s going on.  The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable.  Any typical Western cliché that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone&apos;s masterful storytelling.  Of special mention is Ennio Morricone&apos;s score, which is absolutely perfect.  Two scenes - one in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone&apos;s powerful score. \n\nThis movie is absolutely brilliant.  If you haven&apos;t seen it yet, I strongly urge to do so.  Immediately.  (And then, go watch `Unforgiven&apos; . . . in a way, I think that `Unforgiven&apos; is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - it&apos;s the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.) `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&apos; is easily one of the best Westerns ever made.

As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump&apos;s travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.",

            "reviewBody": "Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.\n\nThis film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who&apos;s leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn&apos;t feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nThe Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.\n\nIn size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word &quot;epic&quot; and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what&apos;s going on.\n\n10/10",

It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action.  It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development.  The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film.  The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series.  This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn&apos;t mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional.  This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish."

            "reviewBody": "At first, I wasn&apos;t interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you&apos;ll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.\n\nI really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.\n\nThe plot is one of the best movie plots I&apos;ve seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.\n\nMy favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.",

Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain&apos;t gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.\n\nI&apos;ll never get tired of watching Goodfellas; the entertainment value of this film is just amazing. It doesn&apos;t happen very often that every person involved in the process of making a film is at the peak of his/her game. And rarely do art and entertainment come together the way they did here. Storytelling with impeccable pacing, this is what it&apos;s like when a master composer conducts his masterpiece. All hail the king; the most versatile and talented filmmaker of his generation: Martin Scorsese.\n\nMy vote: 10 out of 10\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

            "reviewBody": "Set in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the &quot;mental illness&quot; card to get out of prison time, thinking it&apos;ll be a piece of cake, but he&apos;s wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy&apos;s ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.\n\n&quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&quot; (1975) is a film you&apos;ll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn&apos;t &apos;get&apos; a lot of the insights the film conveys.\n\nThe movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their &quot;therapy&quot; is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer&apos;s expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be &quot;dealt with.&quot;\n\nA lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched &quot;isn&apos;t that bad&quot; or that &quot;she was only trying to do her job&quot;, etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film&apos;s brilliance: Ratched&apos;s malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she&apos;s authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.\n\nThe filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway&apos;s portrayal of Joan Crawford in &quot;Mommie Dearest,&quot; which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn&apos;t such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).\n\nMcMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he&apos;s impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.\n\nNurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That&apos;s because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that &quot;appearances&quot; are not about inward reality and, worse, &quot;the letter kills.&quot;\n\nDespite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you&apos;ll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren&apos;t any good people in such institutions, of course).\n\nNo review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of &quot;Chief&quot; Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.\n\nThe film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nGRADE: A",

A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, &apos;Interstellar&apos; is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like &apos;2001: A Space Odyssey&apos; and &apos;Apollo 13&apos;, &apos;Interstellar&apos; is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can&apos;t be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan&apos;s epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema."

            "reviewBody": "Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling  atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a  thriller because of that.  &quot;Se7en&quot; is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right  from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and  mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It&apos;s  very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the  meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting,  or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer  Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.  Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced  and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some  obvious cliché&apos;s. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and  Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different  in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them  such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play  more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey  truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and  chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of  them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive.  Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police  captain.  The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying  scene&apos;s, this seriously ain&apos;t no kids stuff! The movie has some of the  most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it  aren&apos;t just only the gross scene&apos;s that are good, there are also some  scene&apos;s that are made with lot&apos;s of beauty and profession such as the  library scene.  Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the  ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see.  10/10",

The characters are great, and the character&apos;s development is fantastic! the cinematography is grea, and the acting is fantastic. James Stewart was mind blowing. The whole movie is amazing,touching and encouraging. You cannot describe how good this movie is. Nor can you describe how good the message is.\n\nThis is the best feel-good movie ever. It&apos;s a life changing movie, actually. It makes you feel good to be alive. Do me a favor and watch this movie as soon as possible! When you&apos;re sad, think about the message this movie delivers, because you will get a smile on your face! I&apos;m 14 years old. My English is not very good, but I hope this review was useful!",

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been on a Toho binge for a while now and for the most part the films have been enjoyable, especially those by Kurosawa. \n\nThe earlier films were dark, bleak and unsettling viewing and therefore going into Seven Samurai I was of two minds. First I expected more of the same, in both quality and tone but then on the flipside at time of writing this is ranked as the 19th highest rated movie on IMDB which is incredible.\n\nMy expectations were that it would be good, but that&apos;s about it. Seeing Takashi Shimura in the credits also confirmed my logic that this was going to at least be an entertaining three and a half hours.\n\nI was mistaken, Seven Samurai is not good............it&apos;s outstanding.\n\nWonderfully crafted, perfectly scored, incredibly choreographed, well acted and beautifully written this is well deserving of it&apos;s high place and I would consider it nothing short of a masterpiece.\n\nIf you check out my IMDB rating distribution it&apos;s very clear to see that getting anything higher than an eight is a rarity, this deserves it on so many levels.\n\nI didn&apos;t expect this level of quality further as generally I don&apos;t tend to agree with titles in the IMDB top 250, this however I do I thoroughly unconditionally agree.\n\nA masterpiece and essential viewing, I don&apos;t even need to give the premise of the movie in this review and must simply stress that this is film making mastery at its finest.\n\nThe Good:\n\nTakashi Shimura\n\nVery well shot for its time\n\nPerfectly crafted\n\nThe Bad:\n\nNothing springs to mind\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nAkira Kurosawas should be a household name, not Bruckheimer or Bay!\n\nI&apos;ll put money down now that none of the remakes or movies heavily influenced by Seven Samurai comes close in quality",

            "reviewBody": "The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn&apos;t bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it&apos;s absolutely impossible to forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal&quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he&apos;s also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster&apos;s Clarice Starling asking for Lecter&apos;s help to catch another killer.The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist.He&apos;s a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a film&apos;s ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more.\n\nBest watched with a nice Chianti...\n\nP.S. dear film-buffs, have the lambs stopped screaming?",

No one can see this movies without being altered in some way. No one should miss it with the EXCEPTION of those war veterans that have already been there. The surround sound puts the audience in the middle of the battle. \n\nSteven Spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of, rather than appalled at the movie for its real life depictions. I suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the President each and every time the question of war comes up. This movie would not stop future wars but I would hope the objectives would be much more clearly defined. I say this as a US Marine.",

The story is of the many young (pre and early-teen) criminals inhabiting an area just outside the big city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It has the feel of a documentary with real-life street kids but is upgraded considerably by fantastic camera-work, some very innovative cinematography. In other words: stylish.\n\nMake no mistake: without that stylish look, the film might be too much of a downer. The street kids are interesting but really brutal, so be prepared. I mean, how often do you see 12-year-old killers portrayed on film? The violence, language and drug use are rough in here and what a sad comment on this social problem in Brazil, a country with a huge problem with these street gangs. Overall, a very tough but fascinating film.",

            "reviewBody": "&quot;The Green Mile&quot; is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King&apos;s &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; to the screen.  He does the same high quality work with &quot;The Green Mile&quot;.  The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that.  I can&apos;t understand the complaints.  The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn&apos;t feel three hours long.  The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. &quot;The Green Mile&quot; will haunt you.",

The incredibly human characters (such as the doctor who loved riddles), the fantastic script-writing, the amazing acting, and of course the heartwarming story. This movie proves once and for all how strong we are, as humans, that in the face of adversity we can make the best of things. There is so much love in the characters; Dora&apos;s love for her husband Guido is boundless, as well as Guido&apos;s love for his son. Sure, it&apos;s a slightly unrealistic movie, but hey, aren&apos;t they all a little unrealistic? I&apos;ve also seen people review this movie and say that it made light of the Holocaust, which was of course a dark point in history. I don&apos;t think so; I think that it&apos;s only delicately handled, and because of that, the movie is one that a person can watch in one sitting without being thoroughly disgusted by mankind. I would say that those who think this movie is too &quot;light&quot; are cynical and bitter. The whole point to the movie is to show what love is capable of, and to provide encouragement and perhaps guidance. This movie changed my life from the first time I watched it. I came away with this feeling that no matter what I have to face in life, that I can overcome it. This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone over the age of eleven. The acting is superb (though Roberto Benigni is a little over-the-top, LOL), the story heartwarming and easy to understand. It&apos;s excellent!",

            "reviewBody": "Normally when people tell you about a sequel that was better than the original or just as good, Terminator 2 is always guaranteed to be in their list; why? Because this is THE action movie of all action movies, next to Die Hard, this is the movie that isn&apos;t just about the action as well, but has an incredible story and message behind it that will always stay with you. Terminator 2 like the first Terminator film has memorable lines, moments, and incredible effects. This is the film that made you believe in &quot;liquid metal&quot; machines. Robert Patrick&apos;s performance is flawless, to be honest I found him a million times more terrifying than Arnold in the first Terminator, because Robert looks like this normal average guy, but he&apos;s not like Arnold where he gets shot and you can clearly see he&apos;s a terminator, Robert goes back to human looking and won&apos;t stop. Not only that you don&apos;t know how to stop him. Linda Hamilton returns and gives a great performance as Sarah Conor who is no longer a meek little girl, she has turned into a strong woman who will do anything to protect her son and the future. Arnold is back and he&apos;s better then ever! No wonder in the future they made several terminators that look like him, he&apos;s great entertainment.\n\nEleven years after Sarah Connor destroyed the original Terminator that was programmed to kill her, two Terminators arrive in Los Angeles from the year 2029. The first is a Terminator identical to the one that Sarah first encountered, while the second is a new model which assumes the identity of a police officer. John Connor is now a 10 year old living with foster parents. Sarah&apos;s experiences have made her tougher and more vigilant, but also desperate to warn humanity about the coming apocalypse. After attempting to bomb a computer factory, Sarah is arrested and remanded to the Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane under the supervision of Dr. Silberman. Meanwhile, the Terminators locate John Connor in a mall. After John is rescued and a chase through the L.A. storm drain channels, the original Terminator escapes with John on his motorcycle. The Terminator explains that he is reprogrammed by the future John Connor to protect and obey John&apos;s younger self. The other Terminator is a T-1000, an advanced new prototype programmed to kill John. It is made of &quot;a mimetic polyalloy&quot;, a liquid metal that allows it to take the shape and appearance of anything it touches. It can also form into knifes and stabbing weapons. Learning that the T-1000 will likely kill Sarah and then mimic her to lure John, John orders the Terminator to help free her. Initially, Sarah is terrified by the Terminator; but after seeing it fight off the T-1000, she accepts that they need its help. As they escape the city, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet, the sentient computer system that will nearly wipe out humanity in an apocalyptic nuclear attack on &quot;Judgment Day&quot;.\n\nTerminator 2 is one of the best films of all time, this is a film that I absolutely adore and if someone hasn&apos;t seen it, there&apos;s something seriously wrong. This story is a special one: humans, are we our own worst enemy? Arnold&apos;s line &quot;It&apos;s in your nature to destroy yourselves&quot; is something that always sends chills down my spine because it&apos;s true. I loved the relationship between Arnold and Eddie Furlong, interesting to see a terminator take the place perfectly of a father and you see the pain in Eddie&apos;s eyes of never wanting to let go of the terminator. Like Sarah Conor said &quot; The terminator wouldn&apos;t stop, it would never leave him. It would never hurt him or shout at him or get drunk and hit him or say it was too busy to spend time with him. And it would die to protect him.&quot; meant a lot to me. Like I said, if for some odd reason you have seen this movie, do see it! I promise you that it&apos;s just an excellent film and one that will always stand out against cinematic history.\n\n10/10",

            "reviewBody": "Though now known as &quot;Episode IV-A New Hope,&quot; for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in &apos;77, this will always be the first &quot;Star Wars.&quot; We will always think of it as just &quot;Star Wars&quot; - plain &amp; simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old &apos;Ben&apos;), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO &amp; R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you&apos;d seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn&apos;t possible. But they&apos;d been there before in our minds. We&apos;d read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We&apos;d dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; from 1956 came close, and then there were the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Lost in Space&quot; TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate &apos;em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.\n\nI remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I&apos;d been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn&apos;t disappoint. Luke Skywalker, who stood in for all the boys pretending to be on a galactic adventure, gets swept away from his mundane desert home smack dab into the middle of an honest-to-gosh galaxy-wide civil war! The strength of the narrative is / was amazing. There are no slow spots and you can&apos;t wait for the next scene during the entire experience; and, experience is the better description for it, rather than just &apos;movie.&apos; You can&apos;t wait, for example, for the moment when Luke actually meets the princess; what will happen then? It&apos;s a textbook case of an exciting narrative and what I believe makes this superior to all the sequels (knowing that many feel &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; is superior - I must disagree).\n\nThe one character you really can&apos;t wait to see again is the ominous Vader, naturally. The instant he steps into view during the first few minutes of the story, you just know this is the ultimate villain. This is the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool, the supreme uber-evildoer of the entire galaxy. You just know it by his stance, by his attitude, and by the electric chill that runs through your frail form as he steps down the corridor, moving into the annals of film history with one fell swoop. You can&apos;t wait to see what he does next, what nefarious action will send someone or some planet to its doom. Sure, he seems under the control of Tarkin (Cushing) here and later, the Emperor, but you just know he&apos;s simply biding his time until he takes over the whole damn universe. There is no precedent for Vader, and nothing close to him after. He&apos;s at his best here where there&apos;s still much mystery attached to his dark frightful form, a minion of Satan and Nazi stormtroopers all rolled into one.\n\nThis was also the movie-experience which catapulted Harrison Ford (Solo) into superstardom. He seems almost childish here, not really straining to create a character, and it&apos;s this flip charm that makes it work, against all odds. He really does appear to have stepped out of the pages of some juvenile space opera, laser guns blazing, all snide remarks and foolhardy bravado. But he also becomes the older brother figure to Luke, who cannot carry the story by himself. Hamill, whose movie career began &amp; ended with Luke, epitomizes the center of destiny for a galaxy. Both humble and arrogant, he&apos;s perfect in the role. Fisher&apos;s main surprise is that she&apos;s not all sugar and sweet as one would expect of a princess. These three characters evolved in the next two films, but they were always at their best here, icons given life for a short period - but also forever in film. The same could be said for Alec Guinness as Kenobi, a first class act all the way. You almost believe this elderly warrior could topple an empire, given enough time. Unless he runs into Vader...",

Fox) is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence.\n\nAfter almost thirty years (2014), this film loses none of its charm, and actually gains respect. The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.\n\nThe script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all.",

The movie focuses on a young girl who is trapped in a sort of &quot;spirit world&quot;. When her mother and father are turned into pigs, young Chihiro has to save her parents before they&apos;re cooked and eaten. It may sound silly, but this tale has more to it than farm animals. When Chihiro is frightened, she runs off. When a boy finds her, he tells her that she must get a job at &quot;The Bath House&quot;. A sort of retreat for spirits. But to do this, she must speak with Yubaba. The witch who rules The Bathhouse. After Yubaba agrees to give Chihiro some work. She takes her name away from her. And she is then called &quot;Sen&quot;. While shes at the bath house, she is put under very hard work. I could say more, but that would be foolish of me. This is a great movie that I think people of all ages should see for themselves. Its an enchanting and heartwarming story that I&apos;ve watched over and over again and have never gotten sick of it. It has been another inspiring movie from Haiyo Miazaki that is above all his best yet. A 10 out of 10 for this wonderful movie."

            "reviewBody": "The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  \n\nThis is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40&apos;s, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren&apos;t any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler&apos;s List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler&apos;s List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn&apos;t put in English speaking Germans).\n\nIn conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski&apos;s best, a deserved of 2002&apos;s Palme D&apos;Or.  Great music too. A+",

There&apos;s so much to recommend this - Lisa Gerrard &amp; Hans Zimmer&apos;s iconic score, the canny casting of Joaquin Phoenix as a foil for Crowe; the realisation that I quote this film in everyday conversation far more than I thought I did. If it should have won the Oscars is a moot point - this is another of Ridley Scott&apos;s superb worldbuilding - one of his primary film-making skills, giving us a Rome that feels recognisable yet still a break from the cliché&apos;s that had seeped in to popular culture before this. That the film&apos;s status was boosted by the DVD boom as it made its way to home release is undeniable, but this remains a film that thrills, absorbs and grips.",

As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.\n\nIt&apos;s a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.\n\nHowever, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride.",

Every animated movie from Disney ever since has been a failed attempt to recreate the masterpiece that this film is. This movie is an anomaly in a market usually dominated by formulaic kiddie-fare. Unlike most films from animation studios, this movie will enthrall you, whether you&apos;re 5 years old, or 50. An epic plot, intriguing characters, great music and hillarious moments make this film a family classic that will endure through the ages. 10/10",

What happens to them should be seen by anyone thinking of starting a war since it tells very graphically what happens to those often forgotten, the children.\n\nLike its companion piece, Barefoot Gen, which tells the story of survivors of atomic bombing and the horrors that were experienced by those unlucky enough not to have been killed out right, this film proves that war is hell for everyone, especially the children.\n\nIts very hard to send anyone out to see this unhappy little film (The previously mentioned Barefoot Gen spawned sequels, this has not) but at the same time you owe it to yourself to experience, however distantly what sort of monster we unleash upon the world every time we go to war. It helps that however depressing this is, its also a damn good and incredibly compelling story.\n\n9 out of 10",

            "reviewBody": "Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January, Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd-pleasing intensity. On the surface, it&apos;s a gritty story about a brutal student-mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries. Underneath, it&apos;s a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition. Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing. As a result, it&apos;s the best film I&apos;ve seen in years, and I say that without hesitation. This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts. If writer/director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist, then he has achieved it. \n\nMiles Teller, who&apos;s been steadily growing on me since The Spectacular Now, stars as Andrew Neyman, a 19-year-old aspiring jazz drummer who&apos;s pushed and inspired by the abuse and aspirations of his school band leader Fletcher, played by the ferocious J.K. Simmons like we&apos;ve never seen him before. Chazelle has described the film as an origin story to the jazz musicians of the golden age, and it thrives on the myths of jazz heroes such as Charlie Parker. They&apos;re urgently looking for the next Parker, in search of perfection. But with that comes a great irony. The music genre is known as one for freedom of expression but here the jazz is soulless and mechanical, and that clouds the ethical judgment of the characters. Even so, Fletcher is a man who can tell if you have the right tempo within a bar. Although most of the audience for the film may not know much about music including myself, you get a feel for what he&apos;s looking for and when someone&apos;s wrong even if you don&apos;t know why. Simmons is as good as they say he is. He&apos;s a force of nature, with a terrifying presence that incites the fear Bryan Cranston achieved with the peak of his Walter White. But it&apos;s not a one-note performance. Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness, insecurity, approachability, and he also sometimes brings in the lightness he&apos;s known for in other roles with Jason Reitman, exec producer here. \n\nEven though he&apos;s an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say, he&apos;s still somewhat endearing and enigmatic, much like R. Lee Ermey&apos;s drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. This demasculinisation through a barrage of insults is a theme explored in Whiplash and it argues whether it&apos;s a crime or an &apos;ends justifying the means&apos; factor of life. It&apos;s not just a music film, but also one that adapts to the elements of sports training, war at boot camp and biopic genres with the way it frames its elements. Fletcher is representative of the devil on our shoulders that yells at us that we&apos;re not good enough and that symbolic idea resonates deeply for me. His poisonous words are more a part of Andrew&apos;s psyche than legitimate coaching techniques. What grabs me about the film is its discussion on artistic perfection, and especially in these intimate and rough sequences of practicing. What is objectively great in art? When is it good enough, and why? It toes a fascinating line. That&apos;s why drumming is such an interesting choice for the film to explore because it&apos;s so instinctive. Drummers have to make decisions within a fraction of a second and talent can only take you so far. The roaring beat in Whiplash puts your heart in your throat. Teller&apos;s performance as Andrew is terrific, one to match Simmons. \n\nChazelle is committed on expressing the physicality of drumming and Teller captures it exhaustively without feeling contrived. It&apos;s the virtuosity of the writing that allows us into Andrew&apos;s head however. It&apos;s a long road to the top, but the script makes the right decision to allow him to revel in the little moments of success, but then to immediately test him in surprising and involving ways. Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point. While the film is a gripping experience nonetheless, in retrospect perhaps it is too bitingly cynical. It does suggest that you have to be deprived of a meaningful relationship to achieve your goals. It does appear to be very anti-positive reinforcement, but perhaps it&apos;s merely a statement on the abundant sheltering that the latest generation is enduring. Whiplash is refreshing to see, we all know we wouldn&apos;t be resilient enough to take that kind of punishment so it&apos;s cathartic to watch Andrew go through it all and see how far he&apos;ll go. His frustration, regrets, fear and rage with himself cuts to the core of the human condition as he&apos;s pushed further and further. \n\nThe technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography. It&apos;s thoroughly impressive that the film was shot in only 19 days for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements. There&apos;s a refreshing brevity to the film with its sharp atmosphere, but it&apos;s so rich in emotion, psychological tension and personal subtext. It neither rushes nor drags, on paper nor on screen. It really is a film that lingers in your mind for days, nagging you, like Fletcher over your shoulder. Maybe it&apos;ll continue to linger for weeks. I hope so too, especially for Oscar voters. It seems that J.K. Simmons is building momentum to be a lock for Best Supporting Actor at this point. However, Whiplash isn&apos;t just a best of year film, nor best of decade. It approaches best of all-time worthy with its identifiable themes of meticulous work ethics, fulfilling aspirations, resilience of the soul, and knowing when to no longer measure yourself to your mentor. I&apos;ll take this film with me for a while as a screaming motivator.\n\n10/10. Best film of the decade.\n\nRead more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)",

Only then you will truly be moral but if you go around touting your morality, and telling people how moral you are and how immoral they are, that immediately tells that you&apos;re not embodying your morality. A genuinely moral person would never do that because true morality is not based on rules, it&apos;s not a self-image that you adopt, it&apos;s not a list of 10 commandments that you follow.

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it&apos;s even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.\n\nIt&apos;s not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it&apos;s a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.\n\nBasically, it&apos;s a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.\n\nThis is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it&apos;s over!",

            "reviewBody": "Harakiri is an excellent human drama set in feudal Japan that involves a ronin presenting himself to a powerful clan and asking to commit harikiri. However, through a series of flashbacks we see that this ronin is motivated by more than the idea of dying honorably. The events that follow are a critique of the feudal system and a celebration of dying for one&apos;s beliefs.\n\nEvery frame in Harikiri is wonderfully composed and a treat to view. The cinematography is crisp, the sets wonderful and the actors are spectacular. Much can be said about this film&apos;s technical merits as well as its social implications. I found out about this film through my love of Akira Kurosawa&apos;s samurai dramas (who else...) and I must say that it is very different from Kurosawa-sans work although it draws inevitable comparisons. Due to its themes, Harikiri is more of an anti samurai film. Generally Kurosawa&apos;s work seems to glorify the honor of the samurai and celebrate them as Japanese heroes by showing them gloriously in battle. Kurosawa is the Japanese John Ford, taking an icon from his culture and celebrating it. Harikiri exposes the virtues that Kurosawa portrays as being &quot;a facade&quot; to directly quote the film.\n\nI say this so as not to mislead any potential viewers, I do not know enough about Japanese history to judge what the samurai really stood for and really I am not concerned with the idea. This is the only Kobyashi film I have seen and it has been brought to my attention that many of his films deal with similar themes. All in all I think that Harikiri is a wonderful film that offers a new take on feudal Japan.",

            "reviewBody": "Luc Besson&apos;s movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler.  Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a &quot;cleaner&quot;, or hit-man.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.\n\nThe performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant.  Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role.  Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.\n\nJean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about.  Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her.  Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope.  He moves the story along by his actions.  Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.\n\nThe Professional is what movie-making is all about.  Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie.  Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates.  The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.",

            "reviewBody": "There are literally hundreds of comments about this movie on IMDB.  Many of them exhort its greatness.  I don&apos;t disagree with them.\n\nBut I&apos;d like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven&apos;t seen this film.  I&apos;d like to tell you HOW to watch it.\n\nThe people who made this movie didn&apos;t think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted.  The screenwriters were on salary for Warners, writing half a dozen movies a year, and this was just one more.  Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.\n\nSo as an audience member, you can&apos;t sit down expecting gilded greatness.\n\nDon&apos;t have a Casablaca party.  Don&apos;t watch it on your first date, hoping it will lend that &quot;Romantic Touch.&quot;  Don&apos;t watch it as part of your &quot;I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time&quot; Film School project.\n\nBuy this movie on DVD.  Have it at the ready.  And then, one Friday night, when your plans fall through and you find it&apos;s 10:30pm and there&apos;s nothing on TV that&apos;s any good, open a six pack of beer, or pour yourself some wine, and watch this movie in a darkened room.\n\nThe characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism.  Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses.  As Rick says, &quot;Three little people don&apos;t amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.&quot;  If you&apos;re in a mood where you understand what he&apos;s saying, watch this movie and it will transport you.\n\nThere is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time.  Because movies, when all is said and done, don&apos;t amount to a hill of beans.  They are meant to entertain us, not for us to worship THEM.\n\nBut no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.\n\n If you watch Casablance this way, with no expectations, with no &quot;hype,&quot; you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing.  And that will be enough to start you on your way.\n\nHappy viewing, kid.",

            "name": "the American thriller of the nineties",
            "reviewBody": "One day in a bookshop, I flipped through a book entitled: &quot;the movies of the nineties&quot; and this movie wasn&apos;t included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff, any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one&apos;s tastes, some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991). For others it will be &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994) while others will praise to the skies &quot;Se7en&quot; (1995). For me, the pinnacle is this present movie, &quot;the Usual Suspects&quot; (1995) with its staggering story (to put it mildly). It&apos;s a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie, he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller, even the whole cinema.\n\nThe average viewer who watches &quot;the Usual Suspects&quot; for the first time might think that the whole crew concocted him a meandering story with as a leading thread, Spacey&apos;s convoluted story. At the end of the projection, he may feel puzzled and will probably wish to watch the movie a second time. He won&apos;t regret it and Singer and McQuarrie will rejoice at it. Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch &quot;the Usual Suspects&quot; is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle, a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer&apos;s flick, one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey&apos;s declarations and it&apos;s obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It&apos;s up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.\n\nFrom Spacey&apos;s story, the authors developed a top quality script, set with clockwork precision. Singer&apos;s directorial style virtually evolutes on the razor&apos;s edge and conveys an increasing tension. It is filled with ingenious visual ideas and served by fluid camera movements. Singer was in his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents the signs of a seasoned author. There&apos;s also a tight editing and a unsettling score which cement the movie in its place of winner. More remarkable, the authors pull off with gusto to increase the audience&apos;s curiosity throughout the film in spite of a somewhat deliberate confusion and the interest won&apos;t weaken until the end which constitute the apex: an unexpected twist which will leave the audience speechless once they understood it. In Singer&apos;s flick, it doesn&apos;t disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual and verbal clues which justify it. However, it has something unsettling. We believe that we are at the end of the maze but there&apos;s more to the picture than meets the eye. Maybe this &quot;coup de theatre&quot; veils one more truth. Maybe also the shrewdest ones will have guessed it but the result is the same for any viewer: Singer puts a baffled spectator in his pocket.\n\nSinger and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir: an ominous atmosphere, nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point, the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one: a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the stand-out of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don&apos;t neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn&apos;t stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it&apos;s necessary to underscore the fact that they&apos;re lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too.\n\nA riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, &quot;the Usual Suspects&quot; includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision, be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening...",

I&apos;ve not seen a film showing our world with such humour in a long time. The jokes are absurd and possibly, with a touch of British humour to them. The directing is beautiful, the acting is incredible, the shots are somehow truthful, if I can say that about a shot. It may be Omar Sy&apos;s first time in a leading role, for a major production, but he really delivered, and not just in the funny parts, the delivery of emotions was just spotless. Francois Cluzet was also just as brilliant, as he usually is. I will be recommending this film to everyone, and seriously hoping it will be released in the UK soon enough for me to see it again! Only negative aspect... the Americans are thinking of doing a remake... why do they always have to? I mean would you reconsider remaking the &quot;Joconde&quot; or the Sixtine Chapel to American standards? Film is an art like any other, it travels the world as it is... no need for remakes..."

            "reviewBody": "There is something fundamentally sad about Modern Times, by the very fact that it shows an unparalleled genius making his last move in the now-defunct art form with which he made his name. Charlie Chaplin, undisputed master of silent comedy, had managed to bluff his way through the awkward early days of sound, but by 1936 the talkie had got its act together, and screen comedy was dominated by the witty wordplay of the Marx brothers and the smart sass of screwball. Slapstick had all but lost its market, and the picture is saturated with a feel of &quot;One last time&quot; A\n\nnd Chaplin expresses his feelings with scathing satire. Modern Times is quite plainly a blast at many aspects of industrialised living, especially unemployment and Fordist production management. However the picture also takes several sly swipes at sound film itself. From the beginning, sound is associated with the mechanical, the authoritative, and the austere, with the few bits of spoken dialogue being via some piece of technology such as a radio or the boss&apos;s speaking tube. Sound effects too are reserved for nasty clanking and scraping sounds of machinery and things breaking apart. Finally there is Paulette Godard&apos;s pronouncement that &quot;The words don&apos;t matter&quot; as Charlie forgets the lyrics for his singing waiter act. Chaplin was of course very good at nonsense voices, as this and his Adenoid Hynkel act in The Great Dictator demonstrate, whereas meaningful verbal comedy was his Achilles Heel.\n\nDespite all this vehemence, Chaplin is making one or two concessions to contemporary cinema. Modern Times features a lot more camera movement and close-ups than we see in his previous pictures, where he tended to stick to static long shots to preserve the best flow of physical comedy. The more technical approach here is always done for a reason – for example whip-panned close-ups are used for emphasis, and there is often a change of angle to punctuate a gag such as the half-built ship slipping out of dock. While they do draw attention to the funniest moments they disrupt the purity of the routine and are most likely concessions made by Chaplin for an audience not used to silent comedy. Modern Times is also much more variable and fast-paced than previous Chaplin features, skipping from factory to prison to department store and so on.\n\nAnd yet, of all his feature films, Modern Times includes perhaps the most protracted bouts of silent comedy, far more than the story-driven City Lights. Despite its linking plot, the various settings in which the little tramp finds himself each provide fully-fledged slapstick routines, and there are very few moments in which point or poignancy are allowed to overrule the comedy. The picture is in some ways like a compendium of the non-stop gagging two-reelers he was making in the 1910s. Modern Times may not be quite the tearjerker that The Kid or City Lights were, but it is the master&apos;s final great showcase of his primary talent.",

            "reviewBody": "Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Rear Window, wittily written by John Michael Hayes, is one of his many films I think of as much of a technical exercise as anything else. It is in this sense like his silent The Lodger, the static, confined Lifeboat, and the cut-less, one set Rope. Considered in this light it is a cold masterpiece, playing more with the audience&apos;s thoughts and fears than with its softer, more personal emotions. As such, it is a very cerebral and satisfying piece of work. The plot is deceptively simple: a photographer (James Stewart) is stuck indoors with his leg in a cast during a hot New York summer. His socialite girl-friend (Grace Kelly) is eager to marry him but Stewart has his doubts, since he lives a wandering life and is from a different social class. He spends most of his time idling about and playing with his camera. In time he becomes a voyeur (which he probably already is, to a degree) and begins to observe his neighbors&apos; private lives, as he views them through his lens in the courtyard. He develops attitudes toward each of them, ranging from mild amusement to empathy to sexual interest, depending on who he&apos;s looking at. Without realizing it he is really looking at different aspects of either himself or his relationship with Kelly. The courtyard is a kind of mirror of his soul. These people and their predicaments represent different sides of his (and to a lesser extent Miss Kelly&apos;s) personality, offering glimpses of potential past, present and future selves; and it is not always a flattering picture. The newlyweds are continually having sex; Miss Torso is a beautiful young woman who entertains many suitors; there is a childless, somewhat pathetic-seeming middle-aged couple who dote over a pet dog; Miss Lonelyhearts is a depressed, aging spinster with no apparent friends; and the young, bachelor song-writer, when he isn&apos;t trying to compose songs, is either throwing parties or fits. Then there are the Thorwalds, a squabbling couple across the way. Stewart is at first only slightly interested in them until Mrs. Thorwald disappears and her husband starts going out at night carrying paper parcels that look like they came from a butcher shop. Soon Stewart is, understandably, suspicious. He convinces Kelly that something is amiss, but has trouble with his detective friend. His nurse Stella agrees that something is wrong across the courtyard, and the threesome become amateur detectives. Rear Window is great fun. It&apos;s a thriller, a romance, a mystery, and at times a comedy of manners. The actors all give superb, unflashy performances. Hitchcock had been making movies for three decades by the time he undertook this one, and he knew exactly what he was doing; everything happens as it should, on time, with no fuss or bother. The courtyard set is magnificently designed and photographed; it looks both artificial and realistic, and seems almost to change at times, as circumstances dictate. This is, after Dial M For Murder, Hitchcock&apos;s first truly &apos;fifties&apos; film, which is to say it is a far cry from the genteel romances and spy stuff he&apos;d been doing before. There&apos;s less use of atmosphere here, as a new, more independent director was emerging, decidedly post-Selznick, often using color. Hitchcock is playing a sort game of cinematic chess, moving people and things around here and there, changing camera angles slyly, never showing his hand. The film lacks only warmth. All sorts of learned books and articles have been written about this picture, some of them quite silly; all at least partly right. This is at times a profound film, but it also aims to entertain, it has a light touch, and it can be scary, it&apos;s romantic about couples and cynical about people. There&apos;s a little bit of everything in it,--it&apos;s a work of art.",

            "reviewBody": "In full silence, three mysterious men in long trench coats wait in a remote train station. Their faces have anticipation written all over them, even while the most interesting things they can find to do are toying with a fly, drinking water from a hat and cracking their fingers. A dog runs past. The windmill squeaks. The ticket vendor is locked away. The heath bounces off the wooden platform. The men sweat.\n\nAre you bored yet? Then this movie is probably not for you.\n\nBut are you dying to know what the three men are waiting for? Does a light anxiety creep onto you whilst reading that description? Can&apos;t you wait for the tension to resolve? Then this movie is all you ever wanted.\n\nThe almost lawless world where outlaws and bandits roam the country with ease that is the setting of the story, is shown by Tonino Delli Colli (director of photography) in all its splendorous grandeur and it&apos;s uncountable little details. The set pieces, the costumes and the real life locations in Arizona and Utah make everything believable. And together with the characters and figurants, everything creates a vibrant and utterly believable Western civilisation.\n\nCharles Bronson plays the man with the harmonica: a lone wolf looking for something that he chooses not to reveal to anyone until he gets it. A character with no name roaming the endless fields under the sun, announcing his presence at all times with the same melody he plays on his harmonica that echo&apos;s in an unsettling way. Bronson does this brilliantly, with a face that overflows with held back emotions and a determination that is downright scary.\n\nIn a tavern the man meets Manuel &apos;Cheyenne&apos; Gutiérrez (Jason Robards), a bandit that recently escaped being hung by the neck, re-joining his band of outlaws. With already greying hair, he takes on the situation that arises in the area, trying his part to be the hero that saves the day. Robards portrays a character that, by only one look at him, we can see how the years have shaped him. His performance is outstanding; we want to grab a drink with Cheyenne, but we also get the feeling that being on your guard around him wouldn&apos;t be an overrated luxury.\n\nThe &apos;damsel in distress&apos; (although she isn&apos;t in the original meaning of the word) Jill McBain (played by Claudia Cardinale) turns into a toy of Fate itself. Without any warning she gets involved in something quite over her head, but she handles it masterfully; she refuses to return to New Orleans with her tail between her legs and stays to face the difficulties put before her. Cardinale playing Jill is both an erotic marvel and a woman you wouldn&apos;t want to cross.\n\nThey are all opposed by Frank (Henry Fonda): the local gang leader with a heart of stone and a business proposal at the ready at all times. With his ruthless blue eyes and his gun at the ready he keeps the town quiet. Fonda gives you the creeps with just one gaze at the camera and every sentence leaves the bitter taste of malfeasance.\n\nAnd finally, Gabriele Ferzetti finishes the line of main characters with his deliciously sickening portrayal of the crippled railroad baron Morton. A character that you&apos;d like to slap in the face, but one you feel pity for as well. Outstandingly brought!\n\nThe soundtrack is composed by the never beaten maestro of film scoring himself: Ennio Morricone. His genius lies in the creation of themes and melodies that will haunt your dreams forever for better or worse. The melancholic main theme that is brought with a heavenly choir draws tears from your eyes after hearing only a couple of chords. The theme of the man with the harmonica is as unsettling as it is epic and Cheyennes&apos; theme creates the lighter counter points in the movie. Morricone uses these motifs ingeniously, hinting at plot points, character motifs and feelings and giving you a sense of the world the movie takes place in. If I could give twelve out of ten stars for the score, I&apos;d do it.\n\nSergio Leone was a masterful director, no need to prove that. He manages to turn even a scene of seven minutes, where three men are merely waiting for a train, into an epic storyline. Two hours and three quarters the tension builds and then resolves... partially, always building towards the end. And that finale! That finale! That finale chilled me to the bone! Throughout the film, question after question is raised, and when one question is answered, another one pops up. So when all pieces of the puzzle fall into place to the score of Ennio Morricone, how can one not be moved by it?\n\nFor Leone, there was no better way to reach the top of the Western genre.\n\nAnd for us, there never will be a film that is more Western than &apos;Once Upon a Time in the West&apos;.",

            "reviewBody": "I did enjoy the movie, but I saying it&apos;s as good as Dark Knight will be a huge overstatement.\n\nEnough good things have already been said about this movie, so I&apos;ll just point out the negatives:\n\n1. All viallians feel quite weak, bland, and never seem to pose any real threat. Bautista&apos;s character is a joke, Baron isn&apos;t threatening, and the new villian (being called as good as joker by some people) also feels very generic. The *new abilities* that Paul gets also feel too convenient and easy to get.\n\n2. Characters change a lot instantly, Jessica suddenly becomes this completely different character, and same goes with Paul.\n\n3. I can see how it may have to be rushed in the movie format, but the pacing could&apos;ve been better.\n\n4. Paul is the prophesied prophet, and... That just happens with no surprises etc. In some ways, I think that was for the better, as it avoids the overdone struggling hero cliche, but I was prepared to feel tense for Paul, but never really felt that there was a reason to feel tense.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s a solid 8/10, it is a technical masterpiece if you look at cinematography etc., but as a movie overall, it&apos;s just another &apos;good watch&apos; which is well worth its time, and that&apos;s completely fine.",

            "reviewBody": "As always the little tramp is fleeing the long arm of the law when he is mistaken for a wealthy man by a blind girl selling flowers by the roadside. While he longs to help her the tramp knows he cannot. However when he is at his lowest he stumbles upon a drunken man who he helps out who may be able to help him in turn  if the two of them can sober up long enough.\n\nIn response to seeing some modern trash posing as &quot;comedies&quot; recently (Little Man, Norbit, Pluto Nash  I&apos;m looking at you) I decided to check out some comedies that have stood the test of time  a few Chaplin films being among them. City Lights is one of those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not. I knew I had never actually seen it but the wonderful opening scene on the statue and the scenario of the blind girl by the side of the road were very familiar to me and I was right into it from the start. As was often the case, this film has a thin narrative but one that allows for several scenarios for Chaplin to work his magic. And so he does with some classic sequences across the whole film.\n\nThe statue scene is memorable for how he makes so much out of so little but the brilliant choreography of the boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully and imaginatively around the ring. Chaplin is a master and this is just one of many films that shows it as he creates a great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at. His support do no more than that  support him  but yet they are also roundly good. Cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character, while Myers, Garcia, Mann and a few others do good physical work alongside Chaplin.\n\nCity Lights is a really great film that is all the more impressive for still feeling fresh and funny more than seventy years after it was made. The simple narrative is the frame but it is the wonderful and frequent set-pieces that tickle and also stick in the mind. So tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots of modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic to the top of the list instead."

            "reviewBody": "As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film, I find it very interesting how few ,&quot;middle of the road&quot; comments there are. Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film. &quot;Why would you like a film that&apos;s so confusing?&quot; ask many of my associates. The answer is this: Forget the war, forget the brutality....This is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo. Brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done. They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the job, he does it too well, without adhering to the accepted &quot;standards&quot; of death and destruction (Am I the only one who&apos;s troubled by the fact that we have &apos;standards&apos; for death and destruction????), so they send the &quot;Conformity Police&quot; out to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm....Draw any parallels between this and things you see every day? With the deepest respect to Mr. Coppola, whom I believe is one of the best directors of all time, I think he transcended his original intent of the movie, and probably didn&apos;t even realize it until after the movie was released. The subtle sub-text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed; instead, it seems to have &apos;grown&apos; itself, like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. Again I must reiterate: I think FF Coppola did a bang-up job on this entire production, as did the cast and crew, but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten-fold. So if you haven&apos;t seen the movie, rent it, watch it, then watch it again, and maybe a few more times, and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. Only then make a judgment on the quality of the film. Those of you that have seen it, watch it again with the mindset previously described. I think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film. Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story-telling style!",

            "reviewBody": "Losing your memory would have to go close to one of the worst experience anyone could ever suffer from. In the movie Memento&apos;, we get to see how bad it is to suffer from short term memory loss. It also gives us the chance to see how far a patient of such a disease will go to remember what is most important to him. In the vain of Pulp Fiction&apos;, Memento is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. It is no wonder that this movie is so popular with the movie going public around the world. \n\nLeonard Shelby wears expensive, tailored suits, drives a late model Jaguar sedan, but lives in cheap, anonymous motels, paying his way with thick wads of cash. Although he looks like a successful businessman, his only work is the pursuit of vengeance: tracking and punishing the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty of locating his wife&apos;s killer is compounded by the fact that Leonard suffers from a rare, untreatable form of amnesia&apos;. Although he can recall details of life before his accident&apos; Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he is, where he is going, or why.\n\nChristopher Nolan has made one great (but confusing) movie. His style in directing and editing Memento&apos; is quite unique, as no movie has ever been made quite like it before. The story being told in a backward kind of motion makes the audience have to think hard about what they are watching. It also makes the audience feel for a guy like Leonard, whose condition only gets worse and worse as the movie goes on. I am almost 100% sure that Nolan and his brother Jonathan, made up this story in the realisation that it was meant to be confusing. What is also cleverly done by Nolan is the use of black and white and then colour shots. In my opinion, the variations in these shots are used so it confuses the audience even more. \n\n Guy Pearce&apos;s role in Memento&apos; shows me why he is so successful in Hollywood today. Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man on the hunt for his wife&apos;s killer. The only problem is that Shelby is suffering from anterior-grade amnesia&apos;, a disease that cannot be treated. With Lenny&apos;, I feel the audience suffers partly the same condition as he does, and partly does not, as we can remember what has happened in the present. \n\nMemento&apos;s other main stars include corrupt cop Teddy&apos; (Joe Pantoliano). A friend said of Pantoliano&apos;s performance in Memento, he was perfect for the role of Teddy&apos;, as he comes across as the mysterious bad guy&apos;. I could not agree more. There is also the character of Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who is a lot like Teddy in her own way. What is similar about these characters is the way they use Leonard&apos;s condition to advantage their own situations.\n\n Other characters include Sammy Jenkis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who is a victim we learn about from an old case when Leonard Shelby was an insurance investigator. There is Leonard&apos;s wife, Catherine (C.S.I.&apos;s Jorja Fox) who is another fascinating character. Although we do not hear her say much, she is a vital part of this most confusing story. Add in the funny role of Burt (Mark Boone Jnr.), the motel clerk, who openly admits to Lenny that he is ripping him off, by giving him two rooms, but that he will not remember it happening anyway.\n\nYet in no way do any of the characters in Memento&apos; realise they are in a time reversed movie. I am sure that many of the performers would have had to read their scripts many times to understand what was happening from a cinematic point of view. But from an acting prospective, this would have been an easy experience to be part of. Memento also has some interesting devices to tell the story. The way Leonard tries to remember things in the present and the future, via notes tattoos and photographs, making them an important element within the movie. Without them, our hero would not be able to remember anything. \n\nNonetheless, memory is the most vital element in this movie, because without it, people are confused, isolated and abused, which is what happens to our hero&apos;, Leonard.  As Lenny mentions early on in the film, &quot;Memory&apos;s unreliable ... Memory&apos;s not perfect. It&apos;s not even that good. Ask the police; eyewitness testimony is unreliable ... Memory can change the shape of a room or the colour of a car. It&apos;s an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted, and they&apos;re irrelevant if you have the facts.&quot;  But it has to be ironic that Leonard is the one who narrates Memento&apos;, when his recollections and memories of events are inaccurate and jaded. There are also some powerful scenes in Memento&apos;. The one which sticks in my mind the most&apos; has to be where Natalie abuses Leonard, calling his dead wife a whore&apos;, snorting smartly that you won&apos;t be even able to remember what I have said&apos;.  \n\nSo, if you watch this movie and it confuses you the first or even the second time, I can assure you that is how you are meant to feel, confused. If you hated watching Memento&apos; the way Christopher Nolan intended, then I can only recommend that you get a hold of the DVD and watch it in chronological order, as it will really help you. Memento also shows how bad mental disease&apos; patients can be abused by healthy people and what lengths sick patients will go to try and keep sane&apos;. Also, if a movie makes you think, then in some way it has been successful in doing something that many movies do not do  making you think. Those sorts of cinematic experiences are the ones that we need to cherish for life, as they are few and far between. Memento is one such experience. \n\nCMRS gives Memento&apos;: 5 (Brilliant Movie)",

In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.\n\nOf course the story isn&apos;t waterproof, the Nazi weren&apos;t that present in Egypt in 1936 and how did Indy survive that ride on the submarine again? But lots of good and variable action scenes are accompanied by a story that develops fast and excitingly and is always close to being implausible but luckily never is. \n\nSpielberg, Lucas and most of all Harrison Ford created a hero that is nowadays iconic. With their attempt to make an homage to adventure comics of the 1930&apos;s they created their own legend. \n\nIt&apos;s funny, exiting, thrilling and romantic. What more can you ask for?",

            "reviewBody": "After seeing the outstanding Pan&apos;s Labyrinth, I could not understand how anything could beat it to the Oscar for Best Film, let alone the accolade of Best Foreign Film. That was until I saw The Lives of Others.\n\nPutting it simply, this is the best film released in years. The framework of the story surrounds a Stasi officer who is assigned to monitor a writer and his actress girlfriend considered loyal to East German regime. That is all I am prepared to reveal because this film operates on so many levels that I wouldn&apos;t know where to begin. On the surface this can be enjoyed as a taut drama but essentially it is a study of the human condition and the capacity for compassion and humanity exists in even the most inhumane people. All of this is shot against the backdrop of the greys and browns of communist East Germany.\n\nAs a film it is virtually flawless. The three central performances are nothing short of electric, with particularly Ulrich Muhe giving one of the greatest leading man performances since Al Pacino in The Godfather. None of this would be possible without a brilliant script and exemplary direction, that brings the characters to life extracting the best out of the actors. The result is no words are wasted, and every scene is relevant and expertly conceived. This manages to explore deep issues without being turgid, is moving without being draining and remains gripping and entertaining without being superficial.\n\nIn summary, this is film-making at its finest. It is the sort of movie that you&apos;ll go down on bended knee and pay homage to the inventor of cinema, because it is films like this that cinema was created for. You&apos;ll forgive a year of tedious sequels and cash cows, for the one day that films like this get released.\n\n10 out of 10 is too modest.",

Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...).

            "reviewBody": "Until 1950, American films were strictly entertainment, some deeper than others. Studio executives were very protective of image and star-making. In essence, everything seemed perfect. Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, and D.M. Marshman, Jr. created a stunning work of art that splits the Hollywood sign in two and exposed a dream factory for what it really is: a struggle to both gain and keep notoriety in the limelight. &quot;Norma Desmond&quot; and &quot;Joe Gillis&quot; are at opposite ends of this warped Hollywood mindset, with Gillis, played by that most cynical of actors, William Holden trying to pay the rent and Norma (Gloria Swanson) living a lie as a silent queen whose star burned &quot;10,000 midnights ago&quot;. How a picture with such a snide look at the industry could come out in 1950 is simply mind-boggling, considering some of the light fodder that came out of Hollywood at the time. It has inspired many modern day disciples such as Altman&apos;s THE PLAYER, and Sonnenfeld&apos;s GET SHORTY, both of which took their vicious, hilarious parodies to the jugular of the movie capital of the world. SUNSET BLVD is the father of all socially oriented pictures regarding the movies and is by far the best.\n\nThe images of this beautiful black and white powerhouse are fascinating and unforgettable: the dead writer floating in a pool, eyes wide open, looking right at us at the beginning; the eerie pipe organ that plays by the breeze in the middle of one of the most deep and dustiest sets ever; the funeral ceremony of the dead monkey in Norma&apos;s courtyard (&quot;That must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King Kong perhaps.&quot; says Holden in a delightfully crisp and wise voice-over.) Holden pulls his car into a driveway off of the boulevard that will change his life forever. He is the emblem of the struggle to get notoriety. He has only a few B Movies to his credit. Swanson as Norma Desmond is the symbol of lost fame and has become the talk of legend. What is ironic about her character is that she may be playing herself in an odd way. She WAS an actual silent star whose career went down the tubes after the talkies came about. Her madness combined with Holden&apos;s last drop of naiveté combine to give us one of the most electrifying &quot;give and take&quot; between actors I&apos;ve ever witnessed.\n\nBoth lead parts were passed over by several actors. Holden was eventually forced into it as a contract player. How could you pass on such a script? Even &quot;wax figures&quot; (as Holden calls them) Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner, and Anna Q. Nilsson come to Norma&apos;s to play bridge, of course being Hollywood outcasts themselves, after the invention of sound in film. Some of the dialogue takes a swing at actual movies and people (GONE WITH THE WIND, Zanuck, Menjou). This must have brought the house down in Hollywood screening rooms throughout the town. Louis B. Mayer even condemned Billy Wilder for &quot;ruining the industry&quot;. The film is sad and darkly humorous depicting the antics of Norma, who is quite insane, and Holden who is going along with what Norma is giving him, but has plans of his own. Another wax figure still alive and kicking in 1950 appears as himself in an important role. Cecil B. Demille, who once directed Norma/Gloria back in the silent heyday, tries to set her straight, telling her pictures have &quot;changed&quot;. They had indeed, especially after this searing comment on celebrity status. I wonder if they knew what they were creating while making this gem.\n\nScenes are shot right on the lot of Paramount Studios (even the front gate), and Norma&apos;s mansion is an unforgettable piece of history and gloom with a floor that &quot;Valentino once danced on.&quot; There is so much to discuss, but little to enlighten you on how great SUNSET BLVD is without you seeing it. Just two years later, films began to crop up with the same tainted view of Hollywood, most with varying degrees of deception. SINGIN&apos; IN THE RAIN, one of the all-time entertainments quietly had a nasty taste in its mouth regarding celebrity and the invention of sound movies. Watch these films closely and see the skeletons of the modern Hollywood bash films.\n\nRATING: 10 of 10",

            "reviewBody": "There was a lot of hype about this film, which surprised me because when I first glanced at the trailer I just dismissed what I saw as a direct-to-TV film. The hype gave me pause but at the same time made me wait so that it had time to settle into reality. Coming to it outside of the hype and awards, I was open to what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. What pleased me was how creative it was in several areas of production. In terms of narrative it took the risk to be silly with its alternative Spider-Men, but was able to balance that with an engaging and reasonably serious core narrative. It managed to be funny, fun, engaging, and enjoyable all the way through.\n\nAnimation wise it mixed many styles and approaches very well. Even when it felt OTT with the visuals, it still somehow worked and I didn&apos;t feel beaten down or tired as sometimes can happen with visual overload. The overall design of the film added to this, with good use of music, shot framing, and animation to make it feel very cool and fluid throughout. Production-wise, it felt like it &quot;got&quot; the sense of humour of the script and made that work more than it otherwise would have done. Voice performances also seem to get this, and everyone plays their characters well.\n\nOverall, it is creative, funny, engaging, and exciting for those that get into it and accept it on its own terms."

            "reviewBody": "In a recent biography of Billy Wilder, Agatha Christie is quoted as saying that this was the best adaption of her work ever done on the screen. I can&apos;t praise Witness for the Prosecution any higher than that.\n\nTyrone Power in his farewell film plays Leonard Vole who befriends a dotty old widow played by Norma Varden. She even rewrites her will leaving him the bulk of a very large estate. When she&apos;s murdered, Scotland Yard arrests Power.\n\nPower&apos;s solicitor Henry Daniell retains a dream team for defense of John Williams and the recently recovered Charles Laughton. Laughton is recovering from a heart attack and against medical advice plunges into the case. Laughton also has to deal with the efforts of his assigned nurse Elsa Lanchester to keep him following doctor&apos;s advice.\n\nThe original play this was taken from concentrated completely on the Power character and the machinations of his wife. Wilder built up the character of the nurse and barrister Sir Wilfred Robards so that they almost equaled the screen time of Mr. and Mrs. Vole. So much so that Charles Laughton was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957, but lost to Alec Guinness. \n\nMarlene Dietrich plays Mrs. Vole. She&apos;s a war bride over from Germany and she&apos;s got her own agenda going. Her performance and what her character does is the key to the whole film. Dietrich probably would have gotten an Oscar nomination herself, but due to the fact that if her performance was hyped up for Academy consideration, the element of surprise would have been lost in the film. Wilder in fact apologized to Marlene for that.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon legal system&apos;s goal is justice. Justice is served though not quite in the way it usually is in Witness for the Prosecution.",

            "reviewBody": "What can I say about the scariest movie I have ever seen that has not already been said by others more articulate than yours truly?  Do not view this film expecting to see a screen version of the Stephen King novel. Rather, this is a Stanley Kubrick film, and to fully appreciate it one should judge it within the context of Kubrick&apos;s entire body of work as a serious filmmaker.  Thematically, THE SHINING relates most closely to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, though flourishes of PATHS OF GLORY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON do manage to figure prominently in the film&apos;s overall technique.\n\nIn a nutshell (no pun intended), Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall co-star with Oregon&apos;s Timberline Lodge - enlisted to portray the exterior of the Overlook Hotel - in a story that appears on the surface to be about ghosts and insanity, but deals with issues of child abuse, immortality and duality. \n\nWhat the film might lack initially in terms of coherence is more than made up for in technique.  Garrett Brown (the male voice in those old Molson Golden commercials), inventor of the Steadicam, chases young Danny Lloyd through hotel corridors and an amazing snow maze, providing magic-carpet-ride fluidity to scenes that ten years earlier would have been impossible to accomplish.  If the film starts off too slow, remember who the director is.  This man likes to take his time, and the results are well worth it: incredible aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel; horrific Diane Arbus-inspired twins staring directly at us; portentous room 237 and its treasure trove of terrible secrets; elevators that gush rivers of blood in slow-motion; Jack Torrance&apos;s immortality found via the hotel (akin to David Bowman&apos;s journey through the Space Gate); and some of the best use of pre-existing music ever assembled for a motion picture.\n\nIt would take a book to examine and defend the film&apos;s strong points and drawbacks.  If you&apos;ve never seen it, you owe it to yourself to watch it alone with the lights off, with no interruptions, and make sure that it&apos;s raining.  This is a cinematic experience that changed my life at the age of 14.  Makes a great double feature with Robert Wise&apos;s 1963 thriller THE HAUNTING."

This second installment in the Alien series evolves the original movie&apos;s horror/sci-fi genre into action-adventure/sci-fi, setting a standard which has not yet been matched. I like this movie because it paints a picture of the future which is realistic enough to suck you in during the beginning of the film and then quickly introduces you to interesting characters who you become concerned with; some you love and others you hate.....but none of them bore you.  By the time the action starts it&apos;s possible to forget you&apos;re watching a movie (at least the first couple of times).  The plot is filled with tension that is occasionally broken by some of the most memorable one-liners in history (especially by Private Hudson).  The special effects are remarkable, considering the fact that they were accomplished the &quot;old fashioned way&quot; prior to digital manipulation.  I can report that I now own the Director&apos;s Cut and rate this version a 10 also.  The extra footage will be extremely interesting to fans of the 1986 release.  Either version gives you great characters, suspense, action, firepower, sarcasm, and wit.  Aliens is an outstanding show!"

Well, I am relieved to say, Tarantino has not lost his touch. He brings us his best since Pulp Fiction and thankfully so.\n\nWe know the story, a WWII tale told only as Tarantino can. (Fictional of course) A war film hasn&apos;t been done like this before. Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in Nazi occupied France. Their goal - killin&apos; Nazi&apos;s. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He&apos;s know as the &quot;Jew Hunter&quot; and goes about his business as ruthless as no other. The third sub story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnesses the slaughter of her family. And she, of course, wishes to plot revenge on the Germans for her devastating lose. There actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new for him.\n\nWar has never been been so fun. The Basterds, are haunting, but at the same time, very funny, at times even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other Tarantino films. The entertainment and hilarity is led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. I couldn&apos;t wait to see him on screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also making great impressions were Mélanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were tremendous. The film was filled with noteworthy performances.\n\nThe story itself, has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? It isn&apos;t meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun with, as should we. The cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. You&apos;ve really got to love the last line in the film... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece.\n\nQuentin Tarantino among all other things, is an entertainer. WWII, is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino some how manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun film, it&apos;s tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. Jam packed with everything you look for in a movie, done with that certain Tarantino style, it&apos;s worth being checked out. It&apos;s time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino."

This is the best film I have ever seen, over Shawshank, over The Godfather, over The Matrix; this film is a godlike creation from the very, very best of cinema. Do not be fooled by the haters who say it is a poor portrayal of a tradition; the tradition is likely far more beautiful in Coco than in real life. Fantastic, I am blown away.",

            "reviewBody": "Most films about composers- Ken Russell&apos;s &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; about Tchaikovsky and &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; about Beethoven are examples- rely upon the cliché of the creative artist as tortured, neurotic genius. Perhaps we like to console ourselves for the fact that we are not ourselves geniuses with the thought that genius must be paid for in mental suffering. Of course, not all composers fit this stereotype- Haydn was stoical in the face of misfortune (including a miserably unhappy marriage), Rossini was a noted bon viveur and it was often said of Felix Mendelssohn that his forename (Latin for &quot;happy&quot;) well suited his character. But when did you last see a biopic of Haydn, Rossini or Mendelssohn? &quot;Song of Norway&quot; told the story of Grieg, another composer who doesn&apos;t really fit the &quot;tormented genius&quot; label, but it bombed at the box-office. \n\n&quot;Amadeus&quot;, however, attempts to overturn this cliché with a vengeance. The Mozart portrayed in the early scenes is about the least tormented genius who ever lived, obnoxiously hearty and cheerful, without the slightest doubt about his own talents. The tormented character is his rival, Antonio Salieri, but Salieri is no genius; in his own mind he is a hopeless mediocrity whose talents pale into insignificance besides Mozart&apos;s. \n\nThe story is told as a confession made by the now elderly, half- mad Salieri to a priest in 1823, long after Mozart&apos;s death, the earlier scenes being seen in flashback. As a young man, the deeply pious Salieri vows that if God will make him a great composer he will live a chaste, virtuous life and use his talents to God&apos;s glory. At first Salieri believes that his vow has been accepted. He quickly achieves fame and is appointed Court Composer to Emperor Joseph II. When Mozart arrives in Vienna, however, Salieri realises that the young man&apos;s music has a transcendent beauty which his own can never match. \n\nSalieri&apos;s attitude towards his rival is not one of simple jealousy. Were Mozart a man of his own austere, puritanical stamp Salieri would not resent him nearly so much. Mozart, however, is very far from being puritanical. He is not a bad man, but he is very young, and his are a young man&apos;s faults- brashness, overweening self-confidence, a bawdy sense of humour, a keen eye for a pretty girl and a lack of respect for authority. (Actually, those last two are not really faults at all). His most irritating characteristic is his high-pitched laugh like a braying jackass. In Salieri&apos;s eyes, however, Mozart is a vulgar upstart, a smutty, sex-obsessed boy. Salieri believes that God has cheated him, by denying him the musical talent he deserves and giving it to an unworthy recipient. (The title is an appropriate one; Amadeus was not only Mozart&apos;s middle name but is also Latin for &quot;beloved of God&quot;). Salieri therefore plots a diabolical revenge against both Mozart and God. \n\nThe director Milo Forman took the brave decision to cast little-known actors in the three main roles, F. Murray Abraham as Salieri, Tom Hulce as Mozart and Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart&apos;s beautiful young wife Constanze. In each case, however, that decision paid off admirably. Constanze has sometimes had a bad press from biographers, but here Berridge portrays her as strong-willed but loving and kind-hearted. \n\nBoth Abraham and Hulce were nominated for &quot;Best Actor&quot; Oscars, and it was Abraham who won. Good as Abraham is as the gloomy, saturnine Salieri, a man eaten up with obsessive hatred, I still think that Hulce should have beaten him. There is a remarkable contrast between the brash young jackass of the early scenes and the Mozart of the later ones- a more mature, serious family man who has learnt the meaning of responsibility and who is for the first time starting to experience worries- about his finances, about his health, about his career. Hulce&apos;s achievement is that he not only makes these two Mozarts equally believable but also indicates that they are not two distinct individuals but rather two aspects of the same complex personality. There are also good performances from Jeffrey Jones as the conscientious but bumbling and musically tone deaf Emperor Joseph and Roy Dotrice as Mozart&apos;s autocratic father Leopold.\n\n&quot;Amadeus&quot; is not, and is not intended as, a factually accurate biopic of Mozart. As Peter Shaffer, who wrote both the screenplay and the play on which it was based, was well aware, there is no real evidence that Salieri was obsessively jealous of Mozart, and absolutely none to support the old legend that he murdered him. He was not in reality a celibate puritan- he had a wife, eight children and a mistress. Shaffer uses this legend as the basis of a fictional story which explores complex questions about the nature of artistic creativity and the relationship between man and God. \n\nThe film, deservedly, won the &quot;Best Picture&quot; Oscar for 1984; indeed, it is in my view one of the finest films of the eighties. It works on a number of levels- as a lavish piece of &quot;heritage cinema&quot; recreating the Europe of the late 18th century (the sets and costumes are particularly fine), as an intellectual exploration of philosophical issues, as a well-acted human drama, as a fictionalised study of a great man. The soundtrack is heavenly, but that is only to be expected, containing as it does some of Mozart&apos;s greatest music. \n\nThe film has had a curious side effect. It could have condemned Salieri to perpetual infamy as a jealous minor composer who was supposedly responsible for the death of a great one. Instead, it seems to have led to a revival of interest in his work; he is certainly better known today than he was in 1984. Many musicians would now regard him as something far more than the &quot;patron saint of mediocrities&quot;. God may have answered Salieri&apos;s prayers long after his death. 10/10",

The horrors of the nuclear war caused by a simple mistake materialize before us, directed with skill by the late maestro, Kubrick.\n\nThere are simply not enough words to describe Peter Sellers&apos;s BRILLIANT performance in three roles: A british officer, the U.S president and Dr. Strangelove. He is hilarious as the british officer, with his wonderful accent, gloomy and neurotic as the president and simply insane as Dr. Strangelove.\n\nAlso note that this movie includes a performance by very young James Earl Jones, who we now all know as the voice behind Darth Vader.\n\nThe ending scene is also a masterpiece.",

            "reviewBody": "This is by far one of the best, if not THE, movies of the 90&apos;s. &quot;American Beauty&quot; stole my vote immediately as I started watching it. The idea and concept of &quot;American Beauty&quot; is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives.\n\nKevin Spacey plays Lester Burnam, a middle aged married man who has lost some hope in life. He has a job that is degrading, a wife who refuses to show any type of loving emotion towards him, a daughter who practically hates herself, and is judged constantly as a looser. But all of a sudden, he sees his daughter&apos;s friend, Angela, and something snaps in him to do something with his life. He quits his job and takes, the dreaded by most Americans, a fast food cook job. He starts working out and doing some illegal substances. Even though this sounds like he is ruining his life, it actually helps him and makes him realize how much he loves &quot;the precious moments in his stupid little life.&quot; You have no idea what he is talking about I&apos;m sure, but don&apos;t worry, you will some day. Kevin Spacey was by far the best actor in 1999 and deserved this Oscar 100%.\n\nAnnete Benning plays Carol Burnam, Lester&apos;s wife. She is a very fake and unsuccessful real estate agent who cannot get a sale. Her image in life is &quot;in order to be successful, one most project an image of success at all times&quot;. You can tell, she is not happy with her marriage and starts to have an affair with the big boss of the real estate company. Again, seems horrible, but it helps her in the end. Annete was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar for this film.\n\nThe supporting cast: Thora Birtch who plays Janie, Lester and Carol&apos;s daughter, is extremely depressed and hates her body and herself. But when she notices a strange boy next door and develops a relationship with him, she realizes how precious life is and starts communicating with her family. Mena Suvari plays Angela, Janie&apos;s best friend, Lester&apos;s crush, and a girl who is clearly insecure despite her attempts at showing her sexy side to every guy in town. Wes Bentley plays Ricky, the next door neighbor boy who looks at something as simple as a bag being tossed in the wind as something beautiful. Some say that this was a very stupid scene, but I disagree. His dialog was perfect and made us look twice at something so simple. He won most of our hearts despite having somewhat of an arrogant attitude. Wes without a doubt got robbed of a nomination for this movie. Chris Cooper plays Ricky&apos;s father, Col. Frank Fits. He is a military Sergent who is very abusive to his wife and son and is an obvious homophobic that turns into an ironic situation in the end. Chris also should&apos;ve been nominated.\n\nThe most stunning character actually to me was Allison Janney who played Barbara Fits, Ricky&apos;s mom, and Frank&apos;s wife. She was so beautiful and perfect. Her scene in the front room with Frank and Ricky, everything is so quite, and she says &quot;I&apos;m sorry, what?&quot;. Ricky says &quot;Mom, no one said anything&quot;. When Ricky gets kicked out by Frank after a horrible accusation, Ricky says &quot;Mom, I&apos;m leaving&quot;. Instead of being like the average mom and trying to stop him or say things will get better, she knows this is best and says &quot;OK. Wear a raincoat&quot;. Allison was just amazing and didn&apos;t get enough credit for her role.\n\nIf there could have been nominations for every role in this movie, they were well deserved. This is a terrific movie that should be watched by every adult. It&apos;ll make you look again at your life and think. What a great movie.\n\n10/10",

Good Will Hunting is an incredible movie and if I had to say what I think is Gus Van Sant&apos;s best film, this would be it. It is a slow-burner, but I think this was purposefully done and it added to the film&apos;s poignancy and psychological aspect.\n\nGood Will Hunting is a beautifully filmed movie with striking scenery, and it is directed wonderfully by Van Sant. The music is never obtrusive but never too low-key either, while the story is interesting and compelling and the script intelligently written.\n\nThe acting is one of the film&apos;s best assets, as well as its compellingly real characters. Robin Williams is superb in one of his best &quot;drama&quot; roles, while Ben Affleck has never been better and Matt Damon gives another fine performance to match his performance in The Talented Mr Ripley. Minnie Driver is also quite touching and believable.\n\nAll in all, an incredible movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Lethal Weapon is one of those movies where his intensity is on full display but he has a different kind of thing going on here. He&apos;s a tad older, wiser, gets accosted personally and his livelihood, so his intensity is of a different ilk. He&apos;s crazy in Lethal Weapon but in Braveheart he&apos;s completely intense while being completely sane at the same time. All of his actions in this film are justified. You&apos;re rooting for him from frame one. This is the best film he&apos;s ever been in and possible ever will be.",

            "reviewBody": "Das Boot is not just a great war film: it&apos;s a great film period. Maybe it is true that epic themes make the greatest novels and films.  Here is a movie that explores heroism, duty, patriotism, hope, fear and the futility of war--all grand themes--explored in the confined, and collapsing, spaces of a German u-boat.\n\nI saw this film when I was a freshman in college during a weekend that I later dubbed my &quot;depressing movie festival.&quot; (The Wall and Apocalypse Now were the other weekend &quot;entries.&quot;)  Of these films, it was Das Boot that haunted me--when I laid down at night, I saw Jurgen Proctow&apos;s pained blue eyes.  When I woke in the morning, I felt as if I were escaping through the hatch of the submarine.  I could not shake the images, and now some fifteen years later, I still remember how completely meaningless the movie made everything seem, and the nihilistic message stayed with me for a long, long time.  How few films are there which affect the viewers on this level.  To say this film is &quot;powerful&quot; seems so weak a description.\n\nPart of the &quot;power&quot; of the film comes, I think, from a certain restraint in the direction.  So often, films which aspire to move the audience quickly fall into melodrama, over-acting, and overblown images.  Too much.  These often succeed in the immediate response (usually crying) but fail to impact the viewer on anything more than a surface level.  Here, it is the small moments which fill the screen.  Everywhere, all around is War, but for these men as we witness them, war does not begin with a capital &quot;W&quot;.  It is reality, not a grand concept.  The director lets the story shock and horrify the audience, not by forcing it, but by letting the story just tell itself. Drama, tension and resolution occur naturally in Das Boot, which contributes to the very real impact of the film.\n\nStory is a 10, direction is a 10, acting is a 10 and the cinematography is a 10.  One of the all-time greatest films.",

After seeing this for the first time, I could see why so many animators (especially disney animators) consider Mr. Miazaki a GOD! His animation style has the best &quot;flowing motion&quot; I have ever seen.\n\nThe American dubbing team, whoever they are did an excellent job picking voices, they got top notch actors to do the job right (unlike most animes today). They even took on the hair-pulling task of RE-ANIMATING the mouth movements to match!\n\nThis is by far one of the best films I have ever seen.",

I tend to watch animated movies because they have so much more to offer at the same time it is a tougher competition.\n\nThe story line is really good, why? Well it you are open minded it will be pretty easy to follow and accept what is going on, question about how and why get answered by themselves if you believe it is possible. Regarding the animation it give you what your mainstream point of view of Japans architecture, nature, culture and society, all from how they dress to the body language etc. The music, sound effects and voice actor/actress amplifies the emotions and guides you from start till end. There are plenty of a messages and it makes me thing about me and everything living around me, where I come from and where I am going. Regarding the character development its spot on, no more information was needed then what was provided, we are limited but at the same time free to make our own thought.\n\nI wish to say thank you to everyone who have supported and/or worked with this piece of art, they should feel really proud of themselves, it is an honor that you shared it with us (the viewers). Thank you!",

It, in true Kurosawa style (one which Stanley Kubrick matched blow-for-blow, seeming to complement one another in their stunning gifts to the cinema), stands as a fable showing the differences and tensions which the coexistance of different classes creates.\n\nGondo, the rich on high, receives torment from those who live below him, being literally perched upon a hill, overlooking the city in a feudalistic way, in which the king&apos;s palace gazes down upon the serfs below.  As the kidnapper says, &quot;it&apos;s hot as hell down here.  But you wouldn&apos;t know that, you have air conditioning.&quot;  Thus we see the parallels pile upon each other: it is about class warfare but also shows the differences between heaven and hell; and Gondo makes both a descent and ascent simultaneously.\n\nThe plot is simple, but the truth is complicated, and I won&apos;t go into it here, but take my word as it stands: this is an amazing piece of film. See it now or regret it!  Every Kurosawa film is sublime."

I&apos;ve seen clips of Indian films on cable TV and to be honest...I just don&apos;t get it. I don&apos;t get all the silly dancing and singing in almost all movies. I find it so corny and irrelevant to the story. But don&apos;t get me wrong, Philippine movies back in the 80&apos;s were also filled with corny singing and dancing. But we have gone past those and transitioned into movie-making based on good scripts...rather than cheesy story lines. \n\nWhen a friend of mine recommended this movie, I haven&apos;t really heard of it. I thought it was a Hollywood release but it wasn&apos;t. It was a Bollywood movie. He said it was really funny, so out of curiosity, I got hold of a copy. \n\nMy first thought was that it was nothing but a silly story of 3 guys doing slapstick comedy that I have all seen before. When they started singing &quot;All iz well..&quot; I told myself... I knew it! Just what I thought.\n\nBut as the movie progressed...I was amazed at the intelligence embedded in this movie. I was so impressed with the smart dialogues delivered by Amir Khan. It was so mature and thought-provoking. The life crisis all of them were in... the pressures at school..the pressures from society and the pressures from family as well... they rang so true. I was even at one time crying my heart out. I can&apos;t believe it! All the preconceived notions about a Bollywood movie were obliterated. I was so moved by this picture and I have no regrets seeing it.",

The film&apos;s main 2 character&apos;s are the focus of the picture. Without trying to spoil it, the film addresses 3 distinct eras in their lives.\n\nThe film explores the heart, Noodles soul. A man struggling with himself, someone who plays evil acts, a man who sees the pure in his childhood sweetheart. A man never at peace.\n\nThe film is directed by Leone, a master of his art. I&apos;m a huge fan of his work. Each of his films got better and better, and Once Upon A time In America was a picture which had all the experience which he achieved in the 60s. It&apos;s almost a gift to himself.\n\nThe film&apos;s locations are stunning, authentic and dirty.\n\nThe screenplay is excellent, but the direction makes the film. Maybe one or two characters were underwritten, but it seems that the director wanted us to talk about the picture, discuss the possible loose ends, make up our own minds. Leone&apos;s methodical pacing is stunning.\n\nThe acting is tremendous, can&apos;t praise James Woods and Robert De Niro enough, awesome!\n\nThe photography is beautiful, it lacks colour giving it a gritty look, perfection!\n\nMorricone delivers another masterpiece, his score adds further depth and backups the director&apos;s story.\n\nSee it wide-screen, this film is a stunning piece of cinema. Leone, you were the master!"

It was also the first time I saw it at the theaters and I was very impressed with the visuals.\n\nIn this film movies are switching over from being silent to being &quot;talkies&quot;. However the film is a spoof of the turmoil that afflicted the movie industry in the late 1920s when movies when the change over went from silent to sound. When two silent movie stars&apos;, Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, latest movie is made into a musical a chorus girl is brought in to dub Lina&apos;s speaking and singing. Don is on top of the world until Lina finds out.\n\nThis is such a great film that if you ever get the chance to see this at the movies then DO IT.\n\nGene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds made an awesome team.",

People like me, who were born 10-15 years after the war ended, knew it all along first hand from the stories told by parents and grandparents actually living through those times and events. My own mother at the age of seven was thrown by German soldiers into a barn that got lit, her front teeth were knocked out by the butt of a German soldier&apos;s rifle and she, along with tenth of other village kids, was saved by my grand-mother and other villagers only because some partisans had chosen to attack and deliberate the village that day. What most of Western viewers find horrifying, shocking and disturbing is nothing but the truth being accurately depicted by some later movie makers. This movie is pretty much like a documentary that could actually be shot with the help of some sort of a &quot;time machine&quot; in case there was one in 1985 when the movie got filmed.",

Thank goodness too, rather than challenge my brain (not hard to do unfortunately) this film went straight for the heart, ripped it out and kicked it around the floor for 90 minutes. As the addictions plunged further into the depths of Hell, I felt myself more and more arrested by the film. I&apos;ve never left a film shaking or feeling physically ill- not including Pearl Harbour, of course :)  You want to look away, but cannot.\n\nThis movie is by no means flawless, but then again I would like to hope that the flaws add to the gritty reality of the film. The ending was truly the most frightening thing I have ever seen in film- forget the cheap scares of The Exorcist, Psycho and the endless bile of the &apos;slasher flick&apos;, this stuff is REAL.\n\nIn a country amid a &apos;war against drugs&apos; this is a powerful film which could do more to turn kids away from drugs than any measly government &quot;task-force&quot; or classroom lecture."

            "reviewBody": "I was about 10 or 12 when I watched the first Toy Story in the cinema with my little brother and sister. We were all enchanted! Years later Toy Story 2 came out and it was a blast! Again we all went to the theater to see it and we were so thrilled and excited after the movie! Im 24 now, and just yesterday I was at the Bulgarian gala-premiere of the film. My brother was fortunate to win an invitation for two (he took a photo of himself with our small collection of Toy Story toys and sent it to the website), and we had the chance to see the third part on its first screening... and for the 1st time in 3D! No doubt that the animation is better than ever, the guys from Pixar constantly push the limits, but that&apos;s kinda natural for them. But still it feels like 100% Toy Story, with all the improvements, somehow I don&apos;t feel this 15-years-wide gap between the first and the third part.\n\nWhat matters more is the (Toy) Story itself! And it is just fantastic! I had really high expectations of this film and honestly, after seeing it, my expectations were surpassed! The plot is really emotional, with so many nostalgic moments... Being kinda grown-up myself, but doing my growing-up with the first two parts of Toy Story, I couldn&apos;t relate more with this one! I was really touched! I just wish the theater was empty. Then I could stop holding back my tears! And it&apos;s not just t the big story, but also all those little things that go on around it! I don&apos;t know how many of those references and gags were in the script and how many were put in there in the making process, but it&apos;s just amazing! Even if it&apos;s the most dramatic and the darkest of the 3 (as dark as Toy Story can get) the comedy is still there, and I was laughing out loud all the way through! It&apos;s a wild roller-coaster, and I&apos;m not even sure who will have more fun with it, if it will be the kids, or their parents! There&apos;s just so much more in there for you to notice, admire and laugh at! And I&apos;m sure that after watching the film again I&apos;ll find out even more! There&apos;s also a really neat Totoro cameo, and it&apos;s great of Pixar to pay homage to their old friend, Miyazaki san.\n\nThe old lovable characters are all here, and they are joined by an army of new ones, and each one of them has his real personality and you can recognize in them characteristics of someone, both visually and with their attitude they express different things and you instinctively feel what these toys stand for. It&apos;s really funny to recognize in them some movie archetypes or features of people that you know.\n\nI realize that I just poured out tons of superlatives, but there&apos;s nothing else you can say about this film! It has everything! (And about how many 3rd parts you can say that?) The only thing I could criticize is that there is one really freaky baby-toy, that can give the creeps to the smaller kids, but it&apos;s done on a purpose and for me it was really an enjoyable touch to the atmosphere of the film.\n\nTo wrap up this review, I will just say - Thank you, Pixar!",

            "reviewBody": "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Disney+. The storyline follows the Jedi and Luke needing to save their ally, Solo, who even after being saved will need to settle his debt with Jabba the Hutt. Meanwhile, Luke seeks out Yoda to finish his training and the Jedi sets out for one last battle against the evil empire. For them to be successful, Luke will likely need to face his father one last time.\n\nThis movie is directed by Richard Marquand (Jagged Edge) and stars Mark Hamill (Sushi Girl), Harrison Ford (Blade Runner), Carrie Fisher (Sorority Row), Billy Dee Williams (Batman), Ian McDiarmid (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels) and James Earl Jones (Conan the Barbarian).\n\nThe entire Jabba the Hutt opening is always one of my favorite sequences in the series and a great way to start the movie. Harrison Ford was hilarious both in his lines and his body language. He couldn&apos;t have been better cast. The escape scene in this is everything you could want and every scene on Endor is magic. The chase through the woods opening and the mystery and unveiling of the Ewoks was super cool. The final two battles involving Luke, Vader and the Emperor is classic science fiction gold and a wonderful depiction of the force and the dark side.\n\nOverall this movie doesnt get as much credit for its greatness that it should. I would score this an easy 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",

Patrick (Elijah Wood), Stan (Mark Ruffalo), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) are the three slacker technicians who are running Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson)&apos;s machine. As his memories are eliminated, he starts to fall in love with Clementine all over again. He struggles to hold on to his memories before it&apos;s all gone.\n\nThe premise is amazing, but it&apos;s the imaginative visualization of the process that puts in on another level. Jim Carrey pours his heart into this very difficult disjointed performance. It&apos;s very effecting and probably one of his best non-impersonation performance. In its core, it&apos;s a beautiful love story. It&apos;s funny. It&apos;s poignant.",

Everything is told in flashbacks: the mourners&apos; memories unfold naturally, as people remember what the man did and struggle to comprehend why.\n\nThis film I would nominate for the golden five of the century!\n\nI first saw it in 1956 or so at a small theater in downtown Chicago. A second viewing, years later, confirmed my initial pleasure!"

This is supported by those who claim to understand the complexities involved and leading up the Star Child ending. The others, like myself, find it as absorbing as watching paint dry on woodwork.\n\nThe musical background is glorious, the colors are dazzling, and there&apos;s an interesting use of HAL as a villainous computer. Beyond that, there is nothing the least bit interesting about the human characters (trite dialogue and no personality or warmth to any of the individuals), the pace is unbelievably slow (so the intellectually gifted can philosophize on the mysteries of space), and the payoff at the end leaves you either breathless with enlightenment or convinced that you have watched three hours of nothingness.\n\nI had the same letdown feeling when I watched THE CLOCKWORK ORANGE, so your like or dislike of this movie is purely dependent on personal taste. Intellectuals will take the position that you are a mentally challenged clod if you dare disagree with their elevated opinion of the movie--so be aware that this is not conventional story-telling in any sense whatsoever and only for those who admire Stanley Kubrick&apos;s way with unlikely cinematic material."

            "reviewBody": "Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that &quot;less is more.&quot; This doesn&apos;t apply to the violence, the film is extremely violent from beginning to end, but the details of the botched diamond heist, which the entire film is based on, are conveyed only in the dialogue, except for one scene where Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) recalls his escape. The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over, and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch. \n\nThis is not a normal crime film. The thing that really sets Reservoir Dogs apart from all of the others is that it is PURE. When you look at the screen, you&apos;re looking at reality. There are no Hollywood actors, there&apos;s no make-up to make them look pretty, there&apos;s little to no comic relief, and most important of all, there&apos;s no goofy romantic subplot clumsily thrown in, a detrimental trademark of so many action films, as well as  virtually all Jerry Bruckheimer films. Instead of all of that garbage, Tarantino decided to just present the film as simply and straightforwardly as possible, and by doing that he makes it seem that you&apos;re really looking at a bunch of criminals trying to figure out what to do after a suspiciously failed robbery. \n\nEven though most of the actors were known at the time this film was made, the film was delivered in such a way that you don&apos;t see the actors at all, you only see the brutal characters that they portray. It is genuinely frightening to imagine being in the same room with any of them, and this is a quality that is rarely achieved in any kind of film.\n\n Make no mistake, Reservoir Dogs is among the most violent films ever made, and some scenes are really painful to watch, but the way that reality is captured is something that justifies the violent excesses in this film. The violence is never glorified, nor is the criminal lifestyle. When films are overly violent, they usually get branded as such, but despite the extreme violence, Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions. It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino&apos;s classic films, and it will not be soon forgotten.",

            "reviewBody": "Billy Wilder&apos;s &quot;The Apartment is his greatest accomplishment. It is his most successful melding of comedy and drama that he never quite pulled off again. I&apos;m glad the Academy had enough good taste to award Wilder The Triple Crown: Best Picture/Director/Screenplay. But they still had enough bad taste to deny Jack Lemmon a Best Actor award, Shirley MacLaine a Best Actress award and Fred MacMurray a nomination and award.\n\nThe plot this time: C.C. Baxter (Lemmon; in case you&apos;re wondering: &quot;C for Calvin C for Clifford, but most people call me &quot;Bud&quot;)lends out his apartment to executives for their extramarital trysts in the faint hope of a promotion. Eventually, his boss, Sheldrake (MacMurray, excellent in a rare straight role) finds out and wants the key for his own affairs. Meanwhile, Baxter has a crush on Miss Kubelik (MacLaine, in a strong performance)the elevator operator.\n\nFor those who accuse me of spoiling the whole movie: rest assured. This only covers the first 20 minutes or so of the 126 minute feature. Wilder has many twists and tricks up his sleeve and I&apos;ll leave you to discover what happens. What amazes me about &quot;The Apartment&quot; is that unlike most films, this isn&apos;t about the plot. It&apos;s a study in human nature and the mistakes they make. That is a strong trait of most Wilder films (including &quot;Kiss Me, Stupid&quot; and &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot;, both hilarious comedies with a hidden meaning)\n\nAlso the dialogue by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond isn&apos;t just one-liners (although they are funny; especially when spoken by Lemmon and Ray Walston)There is real heartfelt sentiment here and it isn&apos;t the syrupy kind that makes my stomach churn (as in films like &quot;Patch Adams&quot;) Wilder allows enough to make his points and then gets back to comedy.\n\nThe cinematography is fabulous too. Wilder&apos;s film (as most of his 60s films) is in widescreen Black and White (shot by Joseph LaShelle, in Panavision; one of the most unsung and unrecognized cinematographers in history, he was nominated but lost) It has a crisp,clean look and is one of the few widescreen films that actually make the viewer feel confined in a tight space.\n\n&quot;The Apartment&quot; is a superior example of the &quot;serious comedy&quot;, films that work as both comedy and drama. Sadly, many of today&apos;s filmmakers have lost touch with this genre. I can&apos;t help but feel that the freedoms granted today that weren&apos;t in the 1950s and 60s haven&apos;t been an advance. They&apos;ve been holding us back. Smart characters have lost way to stupid and oversexed ones. That&apos;s a real shame and it&apos;s high time we go back to our roots.\n\n**** out of 4 stars",

            "reviewBody": "A man has an inner drive that makes him peculiar and intense. He goes to the desert and falls in love with it and its people. Gaining powerful sponsors, he has a grand vision that he accomplishes by inspiring and directing thousands. But in a very short time, that grand work is compromised and disassembled by fat cats in offices who are concerned with different values.\n\nTrue of both Lawrence and Lean. The legacy of Lawrence is still in violent disarray (I write this a short time after the Sept 11 attacks on New York). But Lean&apos;s vision was saved, and what a vision! Of this picture, it can be said that it is perfect if only because it is so visionary that it defines its own rules.\n\nLean&apos;s vision is also lean, with vast zones of sonic and visual silence -- several meditations on the unperceived. Though there is a story (who are you?) this is really a film of TE&apos;s &apos;Seven Pillars,&apos; which creates a romantic vision of sculpted natural forces. So powerful a depiction that Islam experienced a faddish attraction in the West, a place now enjoyed by Tibetan Buddhism. That was before.\n\nSee here the original Obiwan, every intonation, movement and dress. See here Peter O&apos;Toole&apos;s personality become completely entwined with the character, who is as fictionalized by our eye as by Lowell&apos;s. See the most expressive, anthropomorphic train wreck in history.\n\nWatch a particularly interesting brand of acting by the &apos;Arabs.&apos; Macho men are acting anyway, so an actor can play an actor when he lands such a role.\n\nThe star of the film is the clever eye of God, not the clockmaker or judge of the west but the chess player of the mirage. Its face is clearest in my mind when the Turk holds TE down for torture and smiles. Its hand in the creaking of Feisal&apos;s tent -- who would ever imagine the wind acting? (Kurosawa&apos;s &apos;Ran&apos; at the beginning is the only other example I know.)\n\nI have a few films I admire for various. mostly intellectual qualities. But in the direct matter of visual storytelling, this one tops my list."

            "reviewBody": "When people watch the Oscars, they don&apos;t usually care about the Best Foreign Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer&apos;s mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film&apos;s story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn&apos;t have a great future ahead of them.\n\nBased on the play Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad, Incendies follows a non-linear plot that spans two generations. In the present day, Jeanne and Simon are twins who have lost their mother, Nawal. Nawal has stipulated in her will that Jeanne and Simon must return an envelope to the brother they didn&apos;t know existed who is currently living in a fictional Middle Eastern country. Only then can the twins give Nawal a proper burial. Jeanne feels obligated to return the letter, so she goes to the Middle East, only to realize some of Nawal&apos;s nastiest secrets. As Jeanne uncovers more about Nawal, the viewer is shown Nawal&apos;s story. The film builds up to an unforgettable ending that is sure to rock any viewer.\n\nIncendies already had great source material. I&apos;ve praised the plot enough, but one thing I must add is that the play is apparently four hours long, according to Villeneuve. It&apos;s impressive that this movie succeeds so nicely because I can&apos;t imagine that anything was cut. But to back up that source material, there&apos;s some really great acting. The entire cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work of art wasn&apos;t autobiographical.\n\nFurthermore, Villeneuve has made a film that relies on great filmmaking to impact the viewer. The cinematography is beautifully bland, surely a nod to some of the deserts in the Lebanon- like land where the movie takes place. Color scheme is also used to Villeneuve&apos;s advantage to show the parallels between Nawal and Jeanne&apos;s lives. Villeneuve seems to love working with extended zoom shots that shock the viewer with their overwhelmingly long silences. Why Villeneuve didn&apos;t receive critical acclaim (in America, at least) before Incendies is a mystery.\n\nThere are many movies about the Middle East. Some have failed miserably in their attempts to strike an emotional chord with critics and viewers alike (Redacted, Rendition), but others have been extremely successful (The Hurt Locker, Lebanon). Incendies could very well be one of the best films ever made about the conflicts in the Middle East. It has its flaws which keep it from being a masterpiece (maybe it could&apos;ve lost five or ten minutes), but it is that rare type of film that really resonates beyond the initial viewing. Hopefully, Incendies will be remembered for years to come as the little, brilliant film that spawned the great fame of Denis Villeneuve.",

            "reviewBody": "Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don&apos;t expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from &quot;Scarface&quot;. This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled &quot;American Dream&quot;.\n\nAnybody complaining about the &quot;cheesiness&quot; of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.\n\nThis isn&apos;t Brian DePalma&apos;s strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.\n\nThe cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino&apos;s film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I&apos;ve come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.\n\nPowerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. &quot;Scarface&quot; is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",

I recorded my copy off TV in 1987 so I can only imagine what a remaster would do for it. With an atmosphere thick enough to cut with a knife it never fails to engross and enchant me, and although it&apos;s been dated for 40 years or more still seems relevant and watchable today. TV, answer phones, recordable CD/DVD, memory sticks and the internet have all come between us and yet I can still watch Fred MacMurray speaking into a Dictaphone without a qualm. Who wears a hat in California nowadays? Who buys beer whilst driving! Lift attendants have gone but I can still believe in Charlie working and laughing away in the garage past 11 at night.\n\nWoman and man agree to murder woman&apos;s husband but on the way to the cemetery they face grilling by insurance company. I think everything has been said before on the IMDb - by those who think it&apos;s one of the best films ever made! To those who simply think the main problem is that it&apos;s dated I wish you could see the TV commercials that dug into DI back in &apos;87 - what a hoot - and compare. I&apos;ve just noticed the print TCM UK is showing in 2005 is lip-synced out, very wobbly Rosza music track, fading and ageing fast - worse than my 1987 video tape (maybe logically). They&apos;re supposed to be encouraging people to enjoy the classics but they won&apos;t do that with such inferior screening copies. Dear TCM UK, this is an impressive iconic film - it deserves a billion dollar remaster authorised by the Library of Congress, not repeatedly trotting out unimpressive cheap worn dupes to fill those 2 hour slots.\n\nEverything about DI from the acting, production, direction, and music is superbly dignified and is as &quot;close to perfection&quot; as human beings are probably allowed to get with this form of Art - especially with the more limited technology at their disposal in &apos;44. When most films from now are long forgotten and dated DI will still be getting re-runs on TV and art-house cinemas - God and remasters willing - that is the fact of it.\n\nFortunia Bonanova certainly was fortunate to have appeared in bit parts in 2 of the best films ever made - Citizen Kane the other.",

            "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a difficult undertaking for someone of my generation to watch a film like CITIZEN KANE.  Not because it&apos;s &quot;too old&quot; or &quot;too boring&quot;, but because it has been hailed--almost universally--as the single best motion picture ever made.  And while the anticipation of seeing a film with such overwhelming acclaim may be quite exhilarating, actually watching it is ultimately an intimidating and somewhat disappointing experience.\n\nThis isn&apos;t to say that I thought CITIZEN KANE was a bad film; in fact, I thought everything about it was downright brilliant.  From the enchanting performances right down to the meticulously planned camera movements and clever lighting tricks, there isn&apos;t a single element of CITIZEN KANE that isn&apos;t a stunning achievement in all areas of filmmaking.\n\nCITIZEN KANE&apos;s storyline is deceptively simple.  Even though the plot unfolds by jumping in and out of nonlinear flashbacks, it is surprisingly easy to keep track of.  The straightforwardness and relatively fast pace of the story are what make it seem intimidating.  Because everything moves smoothly along without any standstill, it feels like we are being fooled-like there is something much greater that we just can&apos;t seem to grasp.  As a first-time viewer, I knew from its reputation that there must be *something* that separates this movie from all the others; something buried within its simple plotline that everybody else has seen, but that I just could not seem to get a handle on.  And then, during those final frames, that something was revealed, and it all began to make sense.  To me, it was these moments of confusion and uncertainty followed by a sense of enlightenment and appreciation that made watching CITIZEN KANE such a meaningful experience.\n\nBut no matter how great of a movie CITIZEN KANE really is, it can never live up to one&apos;s expectations.  Although I do feel that it is deserving of its acclamation, the constant exposure to its six decades worth of hype and praise will invariably set most modern viewers&apos; standards at a height that is virtually unreachable--even if it really *is* the best movie of all time."

            "reviewBody": "I have very little interest in most action films or violent movies, so I am not the sort of person that would normally watch a film like &quot;Heat&quot;. However, on a lark and because it&apos;s apparently such a good film I decided to give the film a look. Well, I must say that thought I was not in love with the film it sure was exceptionally well made and had a lot to offer--even for folks like me.\n\nThe biggest reason I liked the movie and thought it was made so well was its rich and complex plot. At nearly three hours, there is lots and lots of time for the plot to slowly unfold. It also allowed for several concurrent plots to interweave themselves through the film--the story about the master criminals, the cops, another criminal as well as a rogue nut-job that just likes to kill. It&apos;s almost like a mini-series in this respect. I also loved how this was not a set-bound film but was made throughout LA--though I wonder how this was possible, as it must have tied up huge portions of Los Angeles! I also loved some of the characters--particularly Robert De Niro&apos;s oddly professional and scary criminal boss. It was one of his very best performances.\n\nThere&apos;s very little to complain about in the film, though I thought Al Pacino&apos;s character was a tad over-acted at times. Unlike De Niro, I had a harder time believing Pacino was real. Perhaps it&apos;s just me....\n\nOverall, if you don&apos;t mind the violence and the occasionally frenetic pace, then this is a film well wroth seeing. Extremely well-directed and never dull.",

            "reviewBody": "M has to be one of the most influential movies ever made, both technically and psychologically. With an outstanding Peter Lorre, suspense that outsuspenses Hitchcock, excellent cinematography and a deep sociological layer added to it, M is one of the masterpieces of the psychological thriller genre.\n\nIt is a film devoid of typical humanitarian propaganda, yet it is not the case that we immediately feel the need to relate to the child murderer Hans Beckert ( Peter Lorre ) since Fritz Lang also shows us the effects his gruesome crimes have in the form of the police constantly raiding establishments, the grieving parents &amp; random people accusing eachother of the murders. It is not a movie that forces its opinion on you, but causes you to think about what is truly right and wrong. Hans later claims he cannot help himself because he has an irresistible compulsive urge to kill which cannot be stopped, much to the dismay of other career crooks who claim they only commit crimes to survive and take no pleasure or feel no compulsion towards it. It is a psychological kind of movie that is still as relevant as ever today as it was in 1931.\n\nPeter Lorre is ofcourse the perfect fit for the psychopathic child murderer, he has the perfect innocent wide eyed look for a psychopath, who seems to even be likeable when he is not murdering children. His signature whistle by Edvard Grieg - In the Hall of the Mountain King is a nice creepy addition to his character which he uses to lure kids to their doom. Ofcourse the incredible shot at the start which focuses on Hans&apos;s shadow on the poster that lists his crimes and reward for capture while talking to a little girl before killing her is a great ironic symbolism to announce his character.\n\nIt was Lang&apos;s first sound picture, yet only two third of the movie was shot with actual sound while everything else was shot silent. This was primarily to keep the costs down since sound equipment was very expensive at the time. It creates a weird mix in constant transitioning from silent to sound. Yet as Lang has stated it adds another layer to the eeriness the movie has, so it only enhances the experience instead of unimmersing you out of the film. \n\nThe cinematography is revolutionary in its use of low key lightning, which is a technique that was used many times after in the classic Film Noir era in Hollywood. The result is many Film Noirs share a visual resemblance with M due to their dark tone. Not only visually, but psychologically many themes of M have been repeated throughout the years in cinema. It was one of the first instances of a semi-sympathetic look on a pure psychopathic murderer, which has been repeated countless times in later years.\n\nSome might feel sorry for Beckert for having this affliction of which he cannot be helped while others would prefer to see him hang, the movie doesn&apos;t shove the right answer down our throats, and it&apos;s possible to look at it from either way without having a right answer. It is a sociological thinking man&apos;s picture that is as relevant now as it ever was.",

The base that they used in England looks very much like Parris Island, right down to the Grinder and the barracks in the background. The part where they are running on the road with Joker carrying Pyle looks like the road to Elliots Beach. The Cadence is true to life as well as Senior Drill Instructor Hartmans dialect, all of the comments I can say 100% that I have heard on The Island and had them used on me. For a person who was there it had me fooled, although the O-Course and the rifle range are completely different in layout and looks. The inside of the barracks and the head are identical to the real thing. For anyone viewing this film trust me it doesn&apos;t get any closer to being Parris Island and I would say that the &quot;Gunny&quot; saw to that. As far as the in country segment it looks pretty much like the real photos I saw in USMC training films."

This film really had me going! Kim Novak was also excellent in her role as the wife. She was so good that I had no idea that she was anything more than object of Stewart&apos;s obsession.

            "reviewBody": "If there&apos;s a list of great computer animation movies of all time, Pixar would dominate most of the top positions. Great story, great voice talent, great timing, great for all ages. It&apos;d be hard to pick just one above another and perhaps another viewing of Up may be in order to figure out where I&apos;d place it among so much stellar work.\n\nUp is by far the most emotional human drama of any Pixar movies thus far, very heavy, so much so if you&apos;re looking for pure fun with some jaw-dropping chase and/or thematic scenes and no downer moments, Up may not be for you. I saw it in a packed theatre of about a 65% adult, 35% adult split audience and it&apos;s the only time I can remember being in ANY animated movie where there was sniffles and watery eyes, and that was within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There&apos;s an undercurrent of life after losing a loved one in this movie, which I don&apos;t feel gives anything away. It&apos;s pretty heavy subject matter, Pixar handles it, like they do everything they touch, incredibly well, but it doesn&apos;t make it any less sad to have the material threaded throughout much of the movie you&apos;re reminded of it, but I suppose it&apos;s up to one&apos;s own interpretation of loss and how to place it in your life that perhaps will have an emotional effect on you.\n\nStory is what makes a great movie great. Without story, you don&apos;t really have anything, maybe some effects, some action, maybe some cute or clever sight gags, maybe some laughs, hopefully some emotion, where Pixar shines above all others in animation and over a good 99% of the movies out there is they can intertwine it all and do it seemingly effortless, which is an incredible feat. To do this in a few movies is one thing, but Pixar has pretty much nailed this now for their entire career of making movies, that&apos;s just simply unprecedented. \n\nI should note I saw the 3D version which, to be honest, didn&apos;t really take the movie to the next level. One of the more well known syndicated reviewers had said you&apos;re better off seeing the non-3D version on screen, and I actually agree. The 3D glasses added little to nothing to the movie except for an eye-strain headache later in the night. It didn&apos;t take away from Up mind you, it just didn&apos;t add to it either. \n\nUp is a great movie either way you slice it and it should be noted, the theatre I saw it in gave it a fairly loud round of applause at the end. It&apos;s pretty rare these days that an audience applauds after a movie, perhaps we as a society has become too jaded, or too just expecting of the goods or feeling we&apos;re entitled to the entertainment. It&apos;s nice when a movie hits on all cylinders and elicits such a range and emotional reaction people who don&apos;t know each other in a packed room all gasp, laugh, cry, and applaud together. Great movies however can do that and Up is truly a great movie."

Yes it is heart warming, but not in the phony Wal-Mart commercial sense; but in the sense of how good you feel when laughing with a dear, dear friend.\n\nThe film tells the story of French waitress Amélie (Audrey Tautou.) She is in her early twenties, lead a gloomy childhood and is missing something in her life until hearing of the Death of Princess Diana causes her to drop the cap of a bottle which rolls along the floor and dislodges a tile on her bathroom wall. What she finds behind that tile leads her to the decision that she is going to do what she can to make the people around her happier by whatever means possible.\n\nAmélie goes about this with great success. One particularly wonderful scene shows Amélie helping a blind man across the street and rapidly describing what&apos;s happening around them to give him a picture of the world he doesn&apos;t get to see. This is only one in a mountain of selfless deeds she does to make people happy.\n\nAs she continues enriching the lives around her, Amélie becomes challenged with the fact that if she only helps others anonymously, she may live her life alone and without the happiness she brings others.\n\nAmélie&apos;s conflict is what rounds out the picture and makes it complete. The movie is deep and takes Amélie&apos;s inner struggle seriously, but it&apos;s never heavy. Brilliantly hilarious, &quot;Amélie&quot; has a wonderfully funny script and is brought to life in visual splendor by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (&quot;Alien: Resurrection&quot;, of all things) and has at its center Audrey Tatou giving one of the warmest, most sincere and funniest performances you&apos;ll see this year.\n\nI can&apos;t tell you how much I love this movie. Just thinking about it gives me goose bumps and I can&apos;t wait to see it again. SEE IT IN THE THEATRE IF YOU CAN! This may be the year&apos;s best picture and is not to be missed.",

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.\n\nMurphy&apos;s portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan&apos;s push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.\n\nSome viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",

            "reviewBody": "I would say that the movie is really a gem of an art piece. The use of excellent imagery coupled with pretty out-of-the-place background score tells us about the uniqueness of this movie. Stanley Kubrick has really applied a lot of thought into this.\n\nThe director wants the audience to feel something as bad not because he is showing it as bad but because it really is bad. The background music accompanying the ultra violent scenes is comical, and not dramatic or anything else that is commonly associated with such scenes. This gives the viewer an opportunity to feel the bitterness not because the music hints so but because he himself feels so. Viewer&apos;s emotions should arise irrespective of what the director is trying to show, and this is one of the greatest successes of the movie.\n\nAnother glorifying feature is the central idea of the movie. If a human is striped of the choice to choose from good and evil, he no longer remains a human, he becomes a clockwork. When Alex is brain-washed and &quot;programmed&quot; to choose only good, he wasn&apos;t accepted by the society and this shows the irony in the objectives of the British Government. The word Orange from the title presumably comes from the word &quot;Ourange&quot; that loosely means man. And hence the title is so appropriate to the movie.\n\nThe artificiality in dialogues and sets give the movie a unique feature and enhance the grip on it. This also means that the viewer has to get more involved. This is definitely one of the best technically shot movies, another masterpiece of Kubrick like the Space Oddessey.\n\nFor the uninitiated, set in near future Britain, the movie shows Malcom MacDowell as the head of a group of youngsters involved in sexual violence. Turn of the events leave the protagonist in the hands of the police. Worried by the growing number of prisoners the British Government devises a method of &quot;programming&quot; them so that they always choose the good. Alex is chosen as one of those on which the new system is to be tested. The rest unfolds as a saga of the very human characteristic.\n\nLastly, I would like to say that you may be compelled to leave the movie in between, but if you are watching it for art and cinematic experience, I recommend you to sit through."

            "reviewBody": "Enough good things can&apos;t be said about this movie.  It is undoubtedly one of the best and most moving films ever made.  No other racial injustice or discriminatory based movie can even compare with &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. This movie not only makes you sympathize with those who were being discriminated against, but also those who fought for those people.  One of the most moving parts of the movie is when Atticus Finch is leaving the court room and Reverend Sykes tells Scout to &quot;stand up your father is passing&quot;.\n\nGregory Peck has always been one of my favorite actors.  This is definitely one of my favorite roles that he has ever played, and he does an excellent job at it.  Mary Badham and Philip Alford are excellent as Jem and Scout. Mary Badham became the youngest girl to receive an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress for her role as Scout.  Although it had a short time on screen, Robert Duvall&apos;s portrayal of &quot;Boo&quot; Radley was one of his very first roles on screen and what better movie than &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; to kick off your acting career.\n\nA great movie of all times.",

We think these kinds of happenings and conflicts would not take place in our lives but with his realistic world and characters they seem so close and possible to anyone. Asghar Farhadi loves to put his audience in place of judge, as his other pictures like About Eli or Fireworks Wednesday and here with no fear he takes us straight to a court room. But the thing is that the judge does not provide any help for us to make a clear judgment and surprisingly makes the situation even more complicated. Yes Farhadi doesn&apos;t want us to make a judgment, He makes us watch and observe and leave the theater with a big fork in front of us.It Seems that any single decision creates another world full of forks and not taken ways.\n\nwhen nobody is clearly guilty and the line between black and white is so dim. And again here we are in Frhadi&apos;s powerful hands surprised to the end of the movie. You can&apos;t leave your chair even for one second because the story never lets you to lose even a single moment. And like a tennis ball we&apos;re always being shot from this side to the other. And finally we are the daughter shocked and disable to make a decision. May be we haven&apos;t seen or we don&apos;t want to see this side of life, where nothing is clear, when small lies and unimportant undone things and unsaid words gang up against us and turn to a big disaster. Frahadi has found his own world and his own language and his own version of life. Something we&apos;d never seen before. We appreciate that. He can easily bombard us with information and surprise us with tiny details that seem nothing but like a snowball rolling down a slope they can form a big drama.",

            "reviewBody": "This original action classic has been hugely influential over the years - and it&apos;s no surprise, as it&apos;s one of the best action thrillers ever made. New meaning is brought to the word &quot;action&quot; as here it is exhilarating, furious and nothing less than exciting. The premise is simple: one location, one good guy and twelve bad guys. Cue lots of explosions, fist fights, blood, violence, and plenty of shooting too. The thrills come from the suspense of Willis using his wits as well as his brawn to fight the bad guys and save the hostages.\n\nWhen watching this film what becomes immediately apparent is how fresh it is. This hasn&apos;t been filmed with some cheap cameras for a quick buck, it looks professional and couldn&apos;t be less polished. The photography is clear and brings out the best of the surroundings, while the music has obviously been carefully chosen to convey the right mood. And, strangely enough for an action film, the acting is actually very good. Unheard of, as remember this was back in the days where Schwarzenegger and Stallone were the top stars of the action genre. Bruce Willis excels as the wisecracking, sardonic cop, and you can&apos;t fail to like him. He&apos;s consistently witty and provides a powerful presence when needed - it comes as no surprise as he lived off this image for the next six or seven years.\n\nThe supporting cast aren&apos;t half bad, either. The reliable Bonnie Bedelia takes a break from her usual highbrow, &quot;moral dilemma&quot;, television movie fare as Willis&apos; tough wife, while Reginald Veljohnson is also great as a sympathetic cop - you just want to hug him. But most memorable of all is Alan Rickman for his excellent turn as the cool, calculating terrorist with a carefully-crafted German accent and a fine line in natty suits. Rickman is THE bad guy of modern cinema, watch any subsequent action film with terrorists and you&apos;ll see people trying to be him. He&apos;s that good. The rest of the cast of terrorists have all been picked for their imposing looks, and they&apos;re not bad either. Keep your eyes peeled for fearsome Bond baddie Robert Davi in a minor role as an FBI man.\n\nAs well as the tense running around in corridors and stand-offs between Willis and the various creeps, this film really delivers in the action stakes. The guys here really do look like they are trying their hardest to kill each other, and we get people flying down stairs, getting chains wrapped around their necks, getting shot all over the place. Every kill that Willis makes is original and exciting. There are also plenty of ace stunts, like when Willis jumps off an exploding roof with only a fire hose tied around his waist. The gore level is high, graphic in fact, with people being shot apart wherever you look, and it&apos;s definitely a film for all cinema fans to enjoy. Consistently entertaining and strong enough to withstand repeated viewings, this is the first and final word on the &quot;one guy versus lots of bad guys&quot; sub-genre of the action flick.",

            "reviewBody": "The Sting.\n\nThe Sting (1973) is one of everybody&apos;s favorite films. Director George Roy Hill took a page from his successful western, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and teamed Paul Newman and Robert Redford once again, this time for an Academy Award four star movie about con men.\n\nThe intricate saga of The Sting is set in 1936 Chicago. It tells the story of grifters, Henry Gondorff and Johnny Hooker, played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford, respectively. They con the bad guy, Doyle Lonnegan, played by Robert Shaw. And at every turn, they con the audience as well.\n\nThe poker game is five card draw (&apos;straight poker&apos; in the film) and is set on a train traveling from New York to Chicago. Newman and Redford are on the train along with Shaw. The game has been set up by Shaw with the cooperation of the conductor. We don&apos;t know how Newman and Redford know exactly what day and what train Shaw is taking from New York to Chicago, but that is beside the purpose of our discussion. Shaw is a known card cheater, but Newman will prove to be a better one. Once again the holy game of poker will be sullied by the movies. This time, we&apos;ll love every minute of it.\n\nNewman arranges to get himself invited to the poker game, through the conductor. He arrives sober, but apparently inebriated. It is the perfect act, consummately played in a boozy, needling performance by Paul Newman. \n\nShaw&apos;s character is a known cold decker (a &apos;cold deck&apos; is a deck introduced surreptitiously into the game with hands pre-arranged to break one of the players)&apos; and Newman will have to play over the top of the cold deck when it is placed into the game.\n\nOne of the subtleties of the event is missed by most viewers. Newman must ready himself to overcome the cold deck. During the play of hands, we see Newman hold the cards close to his vest and, at least once, his cards disappear briefly below table level, out of sight, and back again. Newman knows Shaw cold decks middle cards against low cards, and so Newman is gathering and holding out jacks.\n\nNewman immediately insults Shaw upon arrival and continues to heckle him throughout the play of the game, thus making sure Shaw will cold deck the game to teach the upstart drunk a lesson. When Shaw goes to the men&apos;s room to arrange to fix the cold deck, Newman knows the time has come. (In real life, cold decks were nearly always arranged in men&apos;s rooms. They should have had a dedicated stall marked &apos;coolers made here&apos;.)\n\nThe game is three handed at this point. Shaw will bring the cold deck in when he cuts the cards for the dealer to his left. In filming the cold decking, the camera shows a pair of hands over the deck, then there&apos;s a cut in the continuity. Then the camera goes immediately back to the deck and we see the hands with the warm deck going to a handkerchief in Shaw&apos;s lap, leaving the cold deck on the table. I guess it would have been hard to do in one long shot.\n\nThe detail is interesting during the dealing of the cold deck. Newman is fussing with his cigar and poking behind his vest, implying something is happening. But we never see Newman with hand positions that could be holding out cards.\n\nNewman is dealt trip threes and Shaw is dealt a pair of nines. The third player is the dealer and he is out of the hand. Newman draws two cards and gets his four threes with the six of hearts. Shaw draws three cards and gets his four nines with the ten of spades.\n\nThe planning of the arranged cold deck is well done and probable. After the cards are dealt, the cards on top of the deck are, in order, a three, the six of hearts, two nines and the ten of spades. It doesn&apos;t matter whether Newman draws one or two cards, he&apos;ll make his four threes and, in either case, Shaw, in drawing three cards, will make his four nines.\n\nNow, here&apos;s the unlikely trick. Newman must change the hand with four threes for a hand with four jacks. It would be easiest to hold out an entire hand of four jacks and a fifth card and switch five card hands. But Newman switches only the four threes for the four jacks he&apos;s held out and he keeps the six of hearts. That is much harder to do and less likely would be the method chosen. Newman also takes the chance that Shaw won&apos;t have one of the legitimate jacks in his hand with the four nines, but in having to play over the top of the cold deck, that gamble is unavoidable.\n\nShaw&apos;s problem is that he can&apos;t call Newman for card manipulation because Shaw has an audience, the other players and the conductor. After Newman leaves the cabin, Shaw says to his lackey, &apos;What was I supposed to do? Call him for cheating better than me, in front of the others?&apos;\n\nShaw was able to get $10,000 more in chips during a hand in a table stakes game. But that was okay with Newman.\n\nThe film shows Shaw wiping his face with a handkerchief during the play of the hand, implying he has disposed of the warm deck. However, we never see Newman clean up. So, when he leaves the poker cabin, one deck is short four jacks, the other deck has four extra jacks, and Newman still has four threes behind his vest somewhere. Whoever the conductor gives the decks to next, will have a few surprises.\n\nDespite its faults, the poker scene from The Sting is the most fun filled, greatest directed, best acted, and most involved offering in cheating poker film history. And it was made over thirty years ago.\n\nSilver Dollar Sam NothingWild.com"

            "reviewBody": "When the two greatest filmmakers in the world teamed up to create the best action movie of all time - Raiders of the Lost Ark, it seemed unlikely that they could duplicate their divinely-inspired work. After a miss with the entertaining yet forgettable Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade comes pretty close to doing just that.\n\nFilm history&apos;s most profitable star Harrison Ford returns to his signature role in a performance that speaks for itself, and benefits greatly from a gallery of memorable supporting characters. That includes Sean Connery, the grandest of all modern action day movie heroes (and appropriately cast, as the spiritual father of the character is James Bond). Connery plays against that, in a performance that is different than anything he has ever done, and it works. Even so, Denholm Elliott can&apos;t seem to help stealing every scene he&apos;s in as Marcus Brody, a lifelong friend of the Jones family.\n\nThis movie stands by itself in the way it deals with spirituality, and is thick with religious themes throughout, without preaching to you. This is a very difficult balance to achieve in any film, and that alone makes the film stand out as brilliant. It is more abundant with humor than the previous two films, without the characters falling into irritating self-parody. Being a sequel, this is a difficult balance to achieve as well. (Look at action sequels such as Lethal Weapon 4).\n\nThis film stands among the greatest action adventures of all time. I don&apos;t know anyone who hasn&apos;t seen it, but if you haven&apos;t, don&apos;t walk to see it. Run.",

            "reviewBody": "Technically speaking, I have seen this Fritz Lang silent sci-fi before, but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it. I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the 80s. The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images, the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear. Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis, I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it. So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie. The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable, apocalyptic fantasy, and religious allegory. It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers, who toil in the depths tending the machines, and the upper classes, who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers. The hero, the idle, pampered son of the city&apos;s supervisor Joh Fredersen, changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria, the Madonna of the workers. His father, meanwhile, is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang, who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings. One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didn&apos;t see. In addition to restoring scenes to the film, the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version. With these changes, the story becomes much clearer, particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis. Perhaps most importantly, a whole new subplot is added involving the hero&apos;s dead mother Hel, who was loved by both his father and Rotwang. With this clarification of the back-story, the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer. In some ways it recalls the family back-story of the Star Wars movies. Of course, the real strength of Metropolis isn&apos;t the story, which is pretty silly and probably wouldn&apos;t have worked in anything but a silent film, but its amazing visuals, which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to 2001 and Blade Runner. Actually, though in most respects silent films now look primitive, one area in which they have the edge over modern film-making is in their frequently grandiose production design. Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world. The models of the city&apos;s towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a 1920s film. Even beyond the expansive production design and (for the time) special effects, Lang&apos;s visuals are all consistently inventive. The robot Maria provides some of the movie&apos;s most iconic images, including her transformation into a human being. In a later scene, she performs for upper-class men in a nightclub, and as she performs a striptease that in 1920s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent, the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs. A sign of Lang&apos;s visual lavishness, and the studio&apos;s, that he doesn&apos;t hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a character&apos;s state of mind. For instance, when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines, he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idol&apos;s head into which the workers are being sacrificed. At another point, while he&apos;s sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral. When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers, she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs. labor parable, and Lang gives us spectacular images of the tower&apos;s construction and fall. In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and over-literal, but they&apos;re what silent cinema does best -tell a story without the advantage- or obstacle- of dialogue. The story is a little slow to start, but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that I&apos;ve seen. In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction, Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films, as the workers riot and sabotage the machines, endangering the entire city. Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than 20 years.",

So is the skillful editing, and often original cinematographic style. This time however, it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded, and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro).\n\nEveryone in the film puts in an excellent performance, but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and near-incomprehensible Gypsy boxer.\n\nLike Ritchie&apos;s earlier film, this one takes a little while to find its feet, but once it does the pace doesn&apos;t slacken until the finale. One scene featuring three guys and a squeaking dog in a stolen car stands out particularly, and left the audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered.\n\nWhen it comes to comedies, I cannot recommend this one highly enough. If you&apos;re after a good laugh, you won&apos;t find much to better &quot;Snatch&quot;.",

It&apos;s thrilling, tense, gentle, satisfying, and deeply beautiful. As a huge fan of the war genre, this is unlike any other film I&apos;ve ever seen - it finds its true strength in its unexciting, human moments rather than in the mindless chaos of firefights, while still managing to have some of the most exhilarating and edge-of-your-seat segments I&apos;ve ever seen. Schofield is a brilliant and unconventional choice for the lead character, and his empathy and softness have made him one of my favourite characters of all time and an exceptionally rare example of how quiet tenderness truly can carry a war film better than loud banter and hyper-masculine bluster so often does. Krysty Wilson-Cairns is a genius and George Mackay said so much more in Schofield&apos;s silence than most actors could hope to in the grandest monologue. A masterpiece."

            "reviewBody": "One of the greatest films ever made, L.A. Confidential benefits from a great script (Brian Helgeland), great performances (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, David Straithairn), and great direction (Curtis Hanson). It&apos;s not easy to do a film noir in modern times that is set it in the past. All too often, the performances are too stylized or nonorganic, the direction is stilted -- the whole thing comes off as an attempt, and not a very good one. In this case, though, the result is brilliant.\n\nBasically, L.A. Confidential is the story of three very different kinds of police officers who become involved in the same case, the Night Owl Murders. There&apos;s Russell Crowe as Bud White, the loose cannon, a strong but vulnerable cop; Guy Pearce as Exley, the political, honest, by the book cop who incurs everyone&apos;s wrath; and Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes, the celebrity detective who is a consultant on a Dragnet-type TV show, Badge of Honor. He works hand in hand with a writer for Hush magazine (Danny DeVito). But they&apos;re not the only ones embroiled in the Night Owl diner slaughter. There&apos;s Dudley Smith (James Cromwell), the Chief of Police, Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin), the bisexual D.A., the wealthy, powerful Pierce Patchett (David Straithairn); and Lynn, the Veronica Lake-lookalike call girl (Kim Basinger). And Rollo Tomassi, of course - an important name in the investigation.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to single out any one performance. The film is perfectly cast. The three officers - Spacey, Crowe, and Pearce - are as brilliant as the characters they play are different. And everyone else in the cast is fantastic as well.\n\nHistorically, there are some things that are not correct as far as Hollywood - The Bad and the Beautiful and Roman Holiday did not run at the same time; and the duo of Johnny Stompanato and Lana Turner came later. However, two elements of the film are based on reality or at least rumors - there was supposedly a call girl ring where the women looked like famous film stars; and &quot;Hush&quot; magazine, the cover anyway, looks like &quot;Whisper&quot; magazine from that era.\n\nL.A. Confidential is a story of twists, turns, and camaraderie that take place on the mean streets of &apos;50s L.A., a story that winds up changing the lives of everyone involved. Filled with atmosphere and suspense, it&apos;s a not to be missed, violent, vivid portrait of a time when things at LAPD were (and still might be today) off the record, on the q.t. -- and very hush-hush.",

            "reviewBody": "There&apos;s not much that can be said about &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; that hasn&apos;t already been expressed. It is considered a great work of the Italian cinema, and looking at it in its 1999 release version, one can see why.\n\n Structurally, it&apos;s a theme and variations, with such a simple, clearly stated main motif that one can identify and follow its mutations with no effort.  DeSica is clearly the fine craftsman here, directing every scene with a beautiful sense of control and balance. \n\nHis work with young Enzo Staiola (as Bruno) is especially commendable, and he allows then nonprofessionals Lamberto Maggiorani (as Antonio) and Lianella Carell (as Marie) to act in a model of naturalism. \n\n Carlo Montuori&apos;s photography is brilliant, and Antonio Traverso&apos;s production design is pungent and atmospheric. Like most &quot;masterpieces,&quot; a film-classic score provides emotional depth in a subliminal way: here it&apos;s a romantic, Italianesque original composition by Aessandro Cicognini wraps up the entire production.\n\nDeSica&apos;s career is most impressive, being involved in nealy 200 films, 165 of them as an actor. This film remains one of his greatest achievements.  It seems to be standing the test of time very nicely, too.  It&apos;s been criticized, sometimes quite severely, and just continues to bounce back, winning new admirers with each reissue.  The public just won&apos;t let &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; fade away. That alone tends to override any negative factors. It looks like this film is going to be around for quite a while. ###",

Very good film indeed.\n\nAs I said, it&apos;s a film about Adolf Hitlers final days, trapped in a bunker in Berlin, while the Russians are slowly moving closer. Hitler losing his faith in a &apos;good&apos; outcome, the final bullet, everything is has happened for real. But when I left the cinema I had the idea I had just been watching a fictional story. A perfect script, made in real life 59 years ago. Not much to say about anything else. If you are interested in WWII stuff, go see it in the cinema, it&apos;s worth every penny.",

            "reviewBody": "Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever made. This is one of those films that you do not get tired of seeing and every time you watch it you realize a little detail that you have not seen before. Excellent actors, a good director, an impressive soundtrack and a real story are the main appeals of this film.\n\nThis film is about loneliness, about the isolation of a man in a society full of scum. His objective is to finish with the scum of the streets. The story uses a taxi driver as a metaphor of loneliness and it has some kind of irony because we can see that a city which is full of people can be the most lonely place for a man. The long nights in the city, the night environment full of whores, junkies, pimps and thieves are the main elements of the world in which Travis Bickle lives. Travis is an misunderstood guy who is seeking desperately for some kind of company because as he says &apos;loneliness has followed me all my life, everywhere&apos; but at the same time he seems not to do anything to avoid his situation and it is seen when he goes with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) to a porn cinema. At the end of the film the character makes real his most violent fantasies, with a look of certain soldiers from Vietnam, and he behaves like this because of his loneliness, his alienation and because he does not find any sense to his life. The violent behaviour becomes Travis into a hero, although he had killed many people and he could do it again. Although he acts with an extreme violence the spectator understand him and the reasons why he acts that way. The soundtrack of the film, which is composed by Bernard Herrmann, inspires some kind of loneliness and sometimes it is absolutely terrifying like in a horror film. This music and the slow camera showing the streets help to introduce the spectator into the world of Travis, to know what he is thinking about.\n\nIn general I cannot say any negative aspect of this film because I have not found anything bad. Although it is a film of the 70s it is not an old-fashioned movie because the essence of the story, the reality that is shown on it, can be perfectly referred to the current society. This film has the privilege of having made famous the sentence You talking&apos; to me? You talking&apos; to me?&apos; which will remain in the history of cinema. This is an authentic masterpiece."

            "reviewBody": "Yes, Scorsese has always entertained us so well with abberant types, from mobsters to street criminals to boiler room stock brokers, all dealing death or financial destruction 24/7. But, do any of them bear even a faint resemblance to what really happened, and did those people actually behave that way? Regarding this film, I worked on Wall Street during that time, and even though we had heard of Jordan Belfort&apos;s firm, it was totally discounted as a boiler room and had no Street cred at all, just a terrible rep as sleazebag junk. It was no more than a side story to the real Wall Street, as those boiler room types were the lowest level of that era&apos;s greed-is-good WS slicksters.\n\nBut, the movie.....could any human superman take the amount of drugs and unprotected sex shown in this story and even function, let alone at a high continuous level and not have a fatal heart attack? None that I have known or seen, and I have seen a lot. But, Dicaprio as Belfort was a marvelous choice for this outsized role, and he played it to the hilt as never before, with Jonah Hill as his sidekick comic relief, and Matthew Macconaughey a great choice for Belfort&apos;s oddball, probably whacked out(off?)mentor, and Bob DeNiro in a short mobster spot.\n\nIt was such fast action that the 3 hours went by quickly, with not a dull moment in it. I enjoyed the fantasy ride that Disney could not have done better, but I could never get past the fact that it was 99% dramatized fiction, done to sell tickets(greed is good!) but not to enlighten us at all about the real Wall Street of that era."

            "reviewBody": "Finally, after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader, the Batman franchise is back on track. Having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the Dark Knight, I was especially disappointed by &apos;Forever&apos; and &apos;Batman and Robin&apos;. To me, these film lost the essence of what drives Bruce Wayne to do what he does and turned Batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero.\n\nThankfully though, Nolan has gone back to the roots of the character, portraying a confused and angry Bruce Wayne, who ultimately rises to become Gotham&apos;s greatest champion. Don&apos;t expect to see loads of shots of Batman in this film though. It is the story of Wayne and focuses mainly on his years of training and preparation for becoming Batman. You are almost teased throughout the first half of the movie, waiting to see the excellent Christian Bale in the costume, as it keeps holding back to keep you in anticipation. When Batman does finally turn up on screen, it is well worth the wait. In my opinion, Bale was born for this role and for the first time when watching a Batman film, I enjoyed the scenes of Wayne being Wayne as much as Wayne being Batman.\n\nOne of the strongest features of the film, is the way that it manges to suck you in believe that a &apos;Batman&apos; could be a reality one day. The technology is current, with no use of silly OTT weapons and gadgets, again making the film work by today&apos;s standards. Plus, we are not allowed to forget that Batman is still just a man under the costume and there are times when he gets a bit of a kicking and shows that he can be vulnerable too, something we sometimes forget when watching a superhero flick. Gone too, are the silly villains!!! Jack Nicholson was the perfect Joker but from there it went downhill. Thankfully, in this movie the bad guys are actually fairly &apos;normal&apos; and manage to be menacing at the same time.\n\nWhich finally brings me to the cast. I always had high expectations for this film when the cast was announced. Let&apos;s face it, what a line up! Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katy Holmes, Ken Watanabe and Tom Wilkinson are not to be sniffed at. Even an old favourite of mine makes an appearance: Rutger Hauer! Awesome. Actors of this calibre would never have gotten involved in this project if they didn&apos;t have faith in Christoper Nolan&apos;s talents and thankfully they took the leap...\n\nFor the comic book fans out there, waiting to see this movie, let me assure you that you won&apos;t be upset. Imagine the darkness of the &apos;A Death In The Family&apos; and the &apos;Year One&apos; story lines. I have never met a fan of Batman who didn&apos;t love these books. Well, this is the kind of Batman you can expect from Bale: Dark, brooding and tortured by his past, yet the hero we have come to love. For those of you who are not comic fans, then just look forward to seeing how Batman should be. This film is a credit to Bob Kane&apos;s original vision and a testament to all the talented artists and writers who keep the legend of the Dark Knight alive in the comic books today....\n\nThank you Mr. Nolan and thank you Mr. Bale. In fact thanks to everyone who worked on this film. Batman finally Begins from here....",

            "reviewBody": "Italian director Sergio Leone changed the face of the Western genre in 1964 when he introduced what would be known as the &quot;Spaghetti Western&quot; with the brilliant &quot;Per un Pugno di Dollari&quot; (&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;). Not only the films looked grittier, violent and realistic; the characters in Leone&apos;s westerns became complex men with complex and obscure moral codes, very far away from the classic clear moral opposites of previous westerns. &quot;Per Qualche Dollaro in più&quot; (&quot;For a few dollars more&quot;), is the epitome of all this. It is a powerful, raw and ruthless masterpiece that transcended its genre and became one of the best movies of all-time.\n\n&quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;, the second in the so-called &quot;Dollars trilogy&quot; (a group of films by Leone with the same style), is the story of two different yet very similar men, Manco (Clint Eastwood) and the Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) are two bounty hunters who are after the criminal named &quot;El Indio&quot; (Gian Maria Volontè). An unlikely alliance occurs between the two lone wolves as they decide to cooperate and divide the reward, but are these two killers after &quot;Indio&quot; for the same reason? \n\nWritten by Fulvio Morsella and Sergio Leone himself, the film&apos;s main characteristic is the complex moral code the main characters follow. They are no longer the perfect clean heroes of classic westerns, both Manco and the Colonel have well-developed attitudes, motivations and purposes; they are neither completely good nor completely bad, they are just real. The story unfolds with a fine pace and good rhythm, it is probably the best structured of the &quot;Trilogy&quot; and the easiest to follow. It is also the one that represents the elements of the Spaghetti Western style the best.\n\nStylistically, the film follows closely the conventions established by Leone&apos;s previous film but it takes them to the next level. The excellent use of minimalistic cinematography and the superb musical score by Ennio Morricone complement Leone&apos;s realistic vision of Westerns and completely redefined the genre&apos;s conventions. &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; is a violent tale of two hunters, and visually the film transmits the same emotions the characters feel. No more myths, the Westerns never felt this real.\n\nClint Eastwood&apos;s super performance as Manco is very important for the success of the film, as he is the one that takes the audience through this brave new world, however, the star of the film is Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Mortimer. In one of his best performances ever, Van Cleef manages to be both menacing and interesting, giving life to Leone&apos;s brilliant script with great talent. Gian Maria Volontè as Indio complements the two big talents as the crazed criminal with a dark past, he is the perfect counterpart of the two lone wolves.\n\n&quot;Per qualche dollaro in più&quot; is a near flawless movie, as every piece of the puzzle falls into the right place to create a marvelous and unforgettable picture. It&apos;s only minor problem may be the dubbing, but fortunately, it still is superior to the one heard in other Italian productions of the same time and it doesn&apos;t hurt the film. \n\nFans will always argue about which of the three films of the &quot;trilogy&quot; is the best, and while personally I prefer &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; over this one, it is just a matter of personal taste as this film is as perfect as that one. A real classic that changed the face of Western as we knew it. 10/10",

I feel if the pace was picked up a bit and/or the 130 min run-time edited down to around 110 mins, this would have been a perfect 10 from me.\n\nExcellent drama and comedy perfectly positioned throughout the film.\n\nA well deserved 8/10 from me.",

What makes &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot; different is two things: the strength of its comedy, and the presence of Marilyn Monroe, then at the height of stardom.\n\nLemmon and Curtis turn in admirable performances both as Joe and Jerry, and as Josephine and Daphne. Tony Curtis does Lemmon one better by creating a third identity, &quot;Junior&quot;, in order to woo Sugar Kane (Monroe).\n\nTying the pair&apos;s story into the Chicago Valentine&apos;s Day Massacre, where a gang war spilled over into a parking garage, leaving a number of people lined up against the wall and shot, is a deft touch (though the serious tone of these gang sequences contrasts sharply with the bulk of the movie).\n\nThe movie does an excellent job building the far-fetched stakes of the movie ever-higher, from their finding refuge from vengeful gangs in a women&apos;s jazz band, to their showdown in the Florida hotel, to the eventual revealing of Curtis&apos; and Lemmon&apos;s identities. The movie&apos;s surprisingly suggestive and risque content is at odds with the time frame of the movie, and even with the period of the movie&apos;s creation. The many smart double-entendres and plays on words are very well-written, and alternate between lowbrow and highbrow comedy,\n\nThe films only fault might be a couple of overlong musical numbers, performed either by the whole band or soloed by Sugar Kane. Though to be expected in a Marilyn Monroe film, these musical acts are literal &quot;show stoppers&quot; that bring the comedic momentum of the film to a screeching halt. However, it is easy to over look these minor defects in the movie as a whole, because by and large it is quite funny  no wonder it s considered a classic  and after all, &quot;nobody&apos;s perfect&quot;."

            "reviewBody": "One of the most creative films ever conceived, let alone made and executed- The Truman Show is on all fronts an absolutely perfect film- and will stand the test of time as an absolute classic. On every singular level this film works astoundly- jim Carrey provides a pitch perfect performance as our titular star Truman Burbank- in an incredible casting decision that I am sure turned a lot of heads at the time. Yes we see some of that classic Carrey throughout the film- but the man can act, and never before had it been brought to such attention as it had with this film- and he captures his role perfectly. The other actors do an excellent job as well, namely Ed Harris and Natascha McElhone- as well as Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich. The direction is fantastic, and much needed for the creative vision of the film at hand. The script is not only well done, but incredibly thought provoking, original, and brilliantly put into flm format. The music is fantastic, letting us feel so much emotion from such simple and classic pieces of work. The pacing is excellent, and the film leaves you with a smile and you wanting more- as I think any good film should. In the end, I have absolutely no complaints about The Truman Show. I&apos;ve seen it more times than I can count, and it&apos;s easily one of my favorite films out there. Its a creative masterpiece that is unlike anything we would ever see today, or anything before it. It may be 20 years old, but The Truman Show may just be one of the most brilliant and influential films ever made.\n\nMy Rating: 10/10.",

            "reviewBody": "This quote is one of the most shocking and yet truthful quotes I have ever heard. It is one of many shocking and intense quotes in the movie. Furthermore Judgment at Nuremburg is one of the most absorbing movies I have seen. Even though most if not all of it is dialog it is very much a haunting film. This film is loosely based on the trials in Nuremburg in 1948. Right from the start the movie captures your mind and never lets it go. \n\nThe acting was collectively amazing. One of the best casts ever assembled which included Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland, Richard Widmark, Burt Lancaster as well as international stars Maximilian Schell and Marlene Dietrich. It is not just the fact that this is a star studded cast that made it so great, it was the way everyone appeared to blend in together. Maximilian Schell gave the performance of his life in this film playing the defense lawyer for Burt Lancaster who give two superb narratives that will certainly stay in your mind forever. Schell&apos;s character use of logic is that of something which will mesmerize use you whether or not you agree or disagree with what he says. Richard Widmark playing the prosecutor gave the type of supporting performance that was necessary for Schell to shine. The way both actors fed off each other was a joy to watch. Then of course the tiny appearances of Garland and Clift were excellent and worth every second they spent on camera. I usually find myself frustrated with cameos and actors receiving recognition for them but this film used cameos the best way I have ever seen. Then of course Spencer Tracy and Marlene Dietrich provided such great presence were perfect for the lead.\n\nThe direction of Stanley Kramer was spectacular as the film intensified more and more as it wore on. It was always engrossing and never let up. The writing of Abby Mann was great, filled up with great material and narratives allowing every actor in the cast to give a superb performance. There were many memorable quotes as well. The writing carried the film forward and allowed all the potential and talent to push this film to another level.\n\nJudgement at Nuremburg is not just another movie. It is a very thought provoking movie. More than that though it is haunting. Just thinking about the course of the events being talked about in the movie became subtly haunting in a way I really didn&apos;t expect. What was the most compelling though was the way we need to separate what we feel with what has to be truly done, with what is truly right.",

By a coincidence the kid ends up in the arms of a tramp, played by Charlie Chaplin of course, and he finds a note that asks if someone will take care of the orphan child. The tramp takes the job and the story continues five years later.\n\nWe see how the tramp and the kid (now played by Jackie Coogan) live and love each other, how they have little sneaky plans to earn money, how they belong to each other. In the meanwhile the woman has become rich and when she does a little charity for the poor she meets the kid not knowing it is hers.\n\nThis is a great feature film with Chaplin as the tramp. He composed the music himself as well and it fits the story perfectly. The kid is very good and he does a great job in scenes where kids can easily overreact. There is one great sequence where the tramp is in dreamland and every single person is an angel. This could have been a great movie on its own. As the film says in the first seconds, &apos;The Kid&apos; is good for a laugh and perhaps a tear.",

The difference here is that the film is from the sufferer&apos;s perspective. You therefore see these events as if you yourself have dementia.

This time he move to a completely different script which keeps the audience humored and thrilled from the first scene till the last! The movie( which i saw at the Berlin film festival!) blew away the minds of many people, the plot being so strong and thrilling which kept the audiences guessing! \n\nWhen it comes to acting Leonardo lets no stone unturned! The supremely talented actor has once again showed that why Martin casts him in his every movie as he is simply superb! He not only fits into the role smoothly but delivers a terrific performance every time! Sir Kingsley being the head psychiatrist of the asylum has also done a marvelous job!\n\nThe film is full of flashbacks and haunting dream sequences that range in location from the island itself to the concentration camp at Dachau. The audience is constantly trapped in a world where one questions what is reality and what is dream. Don&apos;t miss this one!",

Fact follows fiction in the casting of Bette Davis, a star who was an incredible actress but fighting the inevitable - the passage of time. First off, Better Davis was always an incredible actress, no matter what part she took and this was the perfect part for her. Anne Baxter is tremendous in the part of Eve - she plays the part well. It&apos;s multi-faceted and challenging and she definitely rose to the challenge. Celeste Holm is great, too. She&apos;s got a smaller part but does a great job with it. Celeste Holm is an actress who has incredible stature, even in the later years of her career, like when she was in that television show &quot;Promised Land.&quot; But Addison DeWitt - takes the cake. I can see why he won the Oscar. I don&apos;t want to say much about the story. The film is one that has to be taken in as a whole to be truly appreciated. Enjoy it - it&apos;s as tasty as honey! One thing - please never let them make a re-make of this film - it&apos;s perfect. It&apos;s off limits. It would be painting a new version of the Mona Lisa. This one is perfect!"

I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. \n\nWhat it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano&apos;s character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis&apos;s character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.\n\nNow is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I&apos;am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. \n\nNow to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don&apos;t think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.\n\nWhy was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.\n\nYou should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I&apos;m not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don&apos;t like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.",

At the time it was a truly ground-breaking film, managing for the first time to portray dinosaurs in an extremely realistic manner, unlike those plasticine monsters that we were forced to watch in previous monster movies. Jurassic Park will also be remembered as the movie that finally made George Lucas sit up and realise that it was possible for him to make his prequels.\n\nIn hindsight, while it is still an extremely well directed and tension filled movie, the script did seemed dumbed down in order to appeal to as many people as possible - but that&apos;s really irrelevant since this film is all about dinosaurs. One of Spielberg&apos;s brilliantly directed films, it even managed to make me forget Spielberg&apos;s previous disaster of a movie - do you recall HOOK?\n\n8/10."

            "reviewBody": "As a lifelong gambler who has crossed paths with a few fringe types portrayed in the film, I&apos;m well aware of the story, the culture, and the ambiance of the Tangiers, the fictional casino placed in the control of Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (Robert Deniro). Rothstein is not a mob member, but a &quot;moneymaker&quot; for them because he&apos;s the nation&apos;s best sports handicapper. It was refreshing for a movie to finally show that not all gamblers are stupid, but instead one of those who takes advantage of the many who are.\n\nRothstein&apos;s partner in crime is Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), who is far less convincing as a mobster than he would seem to like to believe. Sharon Stone plays the psychotic Ginger, a once-in-a-lifetime role in that it was the only time in my life I could bear to watch her on film. The supporting cast is strong, led by James Woods and Don Rickles (excellent in his dramatic capacity), and the movie is generally well-acted.\n\nIf you are a gambler or know the &quot;wiseguy&quot; culture, the movie doesn&apos;t have to be explained, while if you aren&apos;t, you&apos;ll feel like you&apos;ve stumbled upon the secret meeting place of the mafia and made privy to what is said, without anyone knowing you were there. This film is based on the true story of what happened when the mob tried to put its men in suits and have them heading a casino, and why it has never been tried since. The homage paid to the incestuous nature of Nevada politics was an excellent touch.\n\nMost of us wouldn&apos;t like a guy like Sam Rothstein, nor would we like to be him, but if we go to Vegas for a weekend and stay at a casino/hotel, we&apos;ll have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film&apos;s nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the &quot;old school&quot; types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences).",

Shyalaman, since this film some have been good, some of been woeful, this however has stood the test of time.\n\nA real mind bender, this film is thought provoking, dramatic, unsettling at times, and on occasion a little moving.\n\nArguably one of the best films for Bruce Willis, he&apos;s tremendous here, as are Toni Collette and Haley Joel Osment.\n\nI would never dream of giving a spoiler away, as some have done in their reviews, there&apos;s a big moment in this film, where everything falls into place, it&apos;s very skillfully done, and a real jaw dropping moment.\n\n9/10.",

After all it is Shakespeare and one must be patient with it if they are not a fan of the old school theatre.\n\nColourfull clashing armies, The lord awaiting his fate in a burning castle, a brilliant execution scene (I consider the BEST I have ever seen film ever), and the blind being left in the hands of Buddha?\n\nWhile Seven Samurai will always be his perfection, Ran is more than an enjoyable movie that should be seen.

            "reviewBody": "No Country for Old Men (2007) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nA hunter (Josh Brolin) comes across a group of trucks with dead bodies everywhere and discovers $2 million in cash, which he takes. Soon a psychotic killer (Javier Bardem) is after him while a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to figure out what&apos;s going on. I&apos;ll start off by saying that I&apos;m not a big fan of the Coen brothers. With that out of the way, this is certainly the best movie I&apos;ve seen from them but it goes downhill very quickly in the final thirty-minutes, which are quite horrid to be honest. However, everything before that is masterfully done with a beautiful craft that makes this familiar story come off very original, dark and at times funny. I really enjoyed the slow pace that the film carries but I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s how I should describe it. The movie has plenty of graphic violence and action and what makes it so shocking is that it usually comes out of no where or happens when you don&apos;t expect it. The pace of the film is slow but this helps when the violence breaks out. The performances are all terrific with Bardem stealing the show as the psychotic killer. Whenever he&apos;s on screen you can&apos;t take your eyes off of him and his silent performance speaks more than any words could. I was also very impressed with Brolin who I&apos;m usually hit and miss on. Woody Harrelson has a few nice scenes and Tommy Lee Jones is the old Tommy Lee Jones we all love. The film was a lot of fun until the conclusion, which I thought was quite awful."

Then shows you a great land, I don&apos;t know like a Heaven. You&apos;re traveling one to another. You&apos;re seeing another aspect all the time.\n\nThat is why this movie is so unique. It doesn&apos;t bring you another world. Bring the another world to your world. And somehow It manages to doing that so perfectly.\n\nNot only these but this movie has amazing fictonal characters. The terrifying villain, the innocent daughter that deserves to see miracles, the mother that doesn&apos;t have a choice, the creatures with unique visuals.\n\nActing, costumes, makeups, editing are pretty good.

            "reviewBody": "Unforgiven is about as far from the fantasy mythos of A Fistful of Dollars as Clint Eastwood could get.  No pin-point accuracy with 19th century technology, no desire to &apos;play fair&apos; and face the enemy on even terms.  If you can shoot him in the back...then do it.\n\nEastwood puts in an astonishing performance as the retired killer Muny, saved from his life of thievery and murder by his late wife.  Now, desperately trying to support his children with no income, he is tempted back to his killing ways by the bounty offered by the women of a brothel, one of whom&apos;s number has been savagely beaten and disfigured by a drunken ranch-hand.\n\nThe film follows Eastwood as he wrestles with his desire to honour his wife&apos;s memory and his need to feed his children by returning to the killer that, he fears, is his true nature.  Meanwhile word of the bounty has spread and the events spiral out of control as the sheriff (Gene Hackman) deals with the guns for hire that ride into town.\n\nWhile all the supporting cast are excellent Gene Hackman&apos;s Oscar winning performance even manages to eclipse Eastwoods as the brutal Sheriff. He beats one of the bounty hunters, English Bob (Richard Harris) almost to death and then explains to a journalist, in one of the film&apos;s stand out scenes, how men like he and Muny are so successful at killing. The mood moves from light banter to life threatening seriousness...and back again, with just one move of his head.\n\nOne of the greatest Westerns ever made?  Certainly. Although the fact it&apos;s a western is really secondary.  In truth it&apos;s a tale of the nature of evil and the nature of man.  Eastwood uses the gap between the western myth and reality as an arena to play out his story and does so with consummate style.",

            "reviewBody": "A Beautiful Mind\n\n Director Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience&apos;s heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin&apos;s kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he&apos;ll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.\n\nJohn Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He&apos;s socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.\n\nBut John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia&apos;s a tough disease, folks - it&apos;s still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.\n\nRussell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says &quot;Russell Crowe&quot;, you&apos;ll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he&apos;s playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he&apos;s unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they&apos;re exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he&apos;s a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a &quot;hunk&quot; - their skills as actors aren&apos;t seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.\n\nAnd he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash&apos;s acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that&apos;s the essence of Crowe&apos;s performance. It&apos;s sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.\n\nHis supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she&apos;s the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn&apos;t an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.\n\nAnd yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don&apos;t know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I&apos;ll admit it, it got me right here. But it&apos;s okay; I did that old &apos;guy-crying-in-movie-theater&apos; trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won&apos;t think you&apos;re a girly man.\n\nAt any rate, it&apos;s certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything&apos;s in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",

The entire animated sequence of the O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) origin story is gorgeously animated, as well as being impactful and brutal. 3. The score envelops the movie in a pulsating lively aura, and adds reems of energy to the scenes. 4. The action and fight scenes are incredibly entertaining and brilliantly choreographed. 5. The editing is mostly top-notch, especially with the quick cuts adding a lot of vibrancy to the fight scenes. 6. The costume and set design create the outlandish world perfectly. 7. Both Uma Thurman (The Bride) and Lucy Liu deliver great performances. 8. The sound-mixing is very crisp and clean, and it adds so much weight to the action scenes. 9. The make-up and art production is off-the-charts and, in regards to the gore, helps to make the deaths to feel more potent in their execution.\n\nCons: 1. The slow-motion used is extremely unattractive and pointless. 2. There is annoying minor usage of stock action screams.",

            "reviewBody": "Having had his day as an idolized star and romantic leading man, it was now time for Bogart to get down to the serious business of acting For eighteen years it had usually been Bogart playing Bogart in various shadings Now that Bogart was gone and in his place was an older and far less romantic figure, one who found new challenges and was able to meet most of them successfully This new phase of his continued growth began with a story of three men in search of gold \n\nAlthough &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; is indisputably one of Bogart&apos;s best films, it was co-star Walter Huston who won an Academy Award as did the movie&apos;s director and scenarist, John Huston \n\nBased on a novel by the mysterious B. Traven, the film told a riveting tale which explored the degenerative effects of encroaching greed, distrust, and hatred on three prospectors who team up to search for gold in Mexico \n\nBogart&apos;s Fred C. Dobbs was an amazingly complex creation whose slow disintegration into paranoia was brilliant1y managed on camera He is a born loser with no potential for change in sight Suspicious, unfeeling, savage, and easily corruptible, he seems clearly destined for a tragic fate almost from our first meeting with him \n\nTim Holt was also excellent as Bob Curtin, a man who, like Bogart, is tempted but whose conscience will not permit him to exercise his baser desires. (He could have let Bogart die in a cave-in, but saved him instead.) Young, impressionable, and unprepared, he has never seen the likes of a Fred C. Dobbs and he finds himself overwhelmed and uncertain as to how he will cope with Dobbs&apos;s rage and greed \n\nHowever, it is the director&apos;s father, Walter Huston, who literally stole the picture from both Bogart and Holt as he played Howard, a wise old toothless codger who knew all along what would happen and took it all in stride, kicking up his heels and having a marvelous time Life can&apos;t surprise him any more He&apos;s already had successes and failures enough for one lifetime Like a faithful dog, he&apos;s along for the thrill of the hunt, and should there be another pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, well, that&apos;s just a bonus \n\nIt is mainly the interaction of these three men from their first meeting and uneasy partnership through their final confrontation that made &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; one of Warner Brothers&apos; triumphs of the forties",

This guy&apos;s amazing!\n\nI&apos;ve been exploring the halls of Kurosawa and it&apos;s getting hard to leave. Yojimbo is a FUN film to watch.  Toshiro as the samurai steals almost every scene he is in and I think the epitome of his character  is when he&apos;s in Gonji&apos;s place lying on the floor.  He doesn&apos;t brag, but when he goes into action, that&apos;s it!  As soon as he enters the chaotic town, he doesn&apos;t seem fazed at all and actually enjoys it.  His  demeanor is really amusing and it&apos;s great watching his plan unfold;   how he manipulates both groups to get his way (it&apos;s really funny).  Great thing too is he&apos;s not really a hero and he&apos;s not entirely a villain.  He doesn&apos;t hesitate to kill, but does so methodically.  You also have &quot;characters&quot; including Gonji, the thugs from both sides, and Unosuke with an ace up his sleeve (or robe?) which makes things really interesting.\n\nYojimbo&apos;s mix of dark humor, action, and a great performance from Mifune make for a Kurosawa classic.",

            "reviewBody": "Prisoners (2013) \n\n**** (out of 4) \n\nIncredibly well-made and intense mystery about two little girls who go missing and the detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) put on the case to find them. When the original suspect (Paul Dano) is let go, one of the girl&apos;s father (Hugh Jackman) decides to take justice in his own hands. I really had high hopes going into PRISONERS and my expectations for a great film were met but I must admit that it wasn&apos;t anywhere near the type of great film I expected. A lot of thrillers these days are limited on talk and emotions and instead we just get one big, staged action scene after another. That&apos;s certainly not the case here because the film takes its time (153-minutes) telling its story and there are so many quiet moments where we just see the characters losing their grip and emotions as they try to make sense of not knowing where these two girls are. What really pushes the film over the edge are the terrific performances with Jackson leading the way in what&apos;s the best performance I&apos;ve seen from him. This isn&apos;t your &quot;loving&quot; father in the traditional sense. Instead he&apos;s someone quite scary from the first time we see him and we see how much worse he gets as the picture goes along. While on one hand you sympathize with his situation, on the other hand you really can&apos;t support what he&apos;s doing and often wonderful about his own involvement in things. Jackman really comes off like a man full of emotion and rage and he just doesn&apos;t know how to properly let it out. The anger he shows throughout the film is something so raw that you really do feel as if you&apos;re watching a man who has a daughter missing. Gyllenhaal also deserves a lot of credit for the way he played the detective role. I really loved the various obstacles that his character gets put through and especially the own weakness and at times stuck-up approach. The supporting cast includes wonderful performances by Dano, Melissa Leo, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. The screenplay isn&apos;t going to give you a lot of easy answers and there are many times where you hate the lead characters and can&apos;t find anything in them to root for. I thought it was quite brave that the film was willing to take so many chances and it asks the viewer to ask themselves many questions about how they would react to what&apos;s going on. I can&apos;t say I agreed with all the choices but it&apos;s great that a film actually makes you think as that&apos;s something quite rare these days. PRISONERS isn&apos;t exactly an &quot;enjoyable&quot; film as it has you feeling dirty throughout the running time but if you stick with it the thing is certainly very rewarding."

            "name": "Pixar Remains the Best Family Film Industry Out There Today...",
            "reviewBody": "Pixar Animation Studios has a very good knack for making thoughtful, intelligent and humorous family films (note that I didn&apos;t say kid films). &quot;Toy Story&quot; 1 &amp; 2 and &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; are some of my favorite family films; &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; isn&apos;t one of my favorites, but it isn&apos;t disappointing like &quot;A Bug&apos;s Life,&quot; and it is thoughtful, intelligent, humorous and incredibly watchable, just like the other Pixar films.\n\nAs always, Pixar takes a world of something and completely builds their story around it. In &quot;Toy Story&quot; they gave life to toys and created the world through their eyes. In &quot;Monsters, Inc.,&quot; they showed us the monster world. In my review on &quot;A Bug&apos;s Life,&quot; I said that the reason the film didn&apos;t work very much is because it was about bugs, and not about something mystical like toys or monsters that bring back childhood memories. Well, I guess I was sorta wrong, because &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is all about fish, nothing too mystical about fish, and I still loved it.\n\nThis tale takes place underwater with the fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), whose spouse and baby fish eggs get eaten by a vicious shark in the beginning. All but one egg which Marlin names Nemo.\n\nYears later Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould, Elliot&apos;s son?) is a bit older, and heading off to fish school for the first time. But haunted by the fact that his spouse and offspring were all killed years ago, Marlin is extremely over-protective of his one remaining family member. Nemo, sick of being treated like a baby, proves how brave he is by swimming near a fishing boat, only to be captured by a scuba-diving dentist. And so Marlin heads off to find Nemo, with the help of his newfound companion Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss and forgets things sooner than she can carry whatever she is doing out. (Like when she is showing Marlin the way towards a fishing boat and suddenly forgets why Marlin is following her.)\n\nPixar doesn&apos;t let down the audience on this film. There are a few things that one can always expect from Pixar films: They can expect something (such as toys) to be given their own world. They can expect that world to be given careful attention to detail. And they can expect humor.\n\n&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; gives fish their own world, and the underwater realm they live in is paid careful attention, painstakingly captured on film with computer graphics. And the humor is always there. All the characters are funny. I especially like the sequences from the inside of a fish tank in the dentist&apos;s office, with a bunch of fish including Gill (Willem Dafoe&apos;s vocal talents), who constantly tries to escape. By doing so, Gill has suffered major injuries, including landing on the dentist&apos;s tools and getting sliced up. This is, of course, a parody of escaping POWs. The fact that Willem Dafoe was in the great war movie &quot;Platoon&quot; might have something to do with that.\n\nThis is taken from my &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; review: &quot;Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my &apos;Toy Story&apos; review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience&apos;s INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of &apos;Toy Story&apos; and &apos;Monsters, Inc.,&apos; but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for &apos;Toy Story 3&apos;) and gives them the bare minimum.\n\nWith &quot;Finding Nemo,&quot; I still stick towards what I said. Pixar Animation Studios is probably the best family film company out there right now, I really hope they separate from Disney some day and form their own production company. They know what interests both kids and adults, and it&apos;s almost creepy how they can make their films so engaging and fun to watch. This is one to take the kids to, and afterwards, maybe even sneak back into again by yourself.",

            "reviewBody": "I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers&apos; negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don&apos;t know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.\n\n It is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW&apos;s were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant&apos;s uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW&apos;s built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn&apos;t fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. \n\nAs for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW&apos;s wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.\n\nAs for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW&apos;s participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it&apos;s true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio&apos;s bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see &quot;Hart&apos;s War&quot; where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).\n\nAll in all, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It&apos;s well worth the time."

If you like daft jokes, killer fluffy animals, bad accents and intelligent discussions that will most likely go over your head the first time round, then you will love The Holy Grail.\n\nThe jokes vary from obvious visual puns (coconut halves to represent horses) and audio puns (&quot;I am Roger the Shrubber&quot;) to more subtle and intelligent jokes (&quot;I thought we were an autonomous collective&quot; / the Witch-burning scene). The greatest thing about the Holy Grail is that there&apos;s something for everyone. No one is left out.\n\nWhat many don&apos;t realise is the sophisticated intelligence behind the jokes that many of later generations don&apos;t understand (back in the Life of Brian - Romani Ite Domun - which wouldn&apos;t have such impact on the youngsters who never had to suffer through Latin classes) such as the witch burning scene, where it was true that any means possible was used to warp the natural and legal laws to create the desired result i.e. one less warty woman in the village, and how the mish-mash of Celtic tribes were suddenly forced to become a diplomacy (&quot;Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony!&quot;). It always reminds me of Blackadder - how so many great jokes were wasted by bad timing or bad judgement on the audience&apos;s vocabulary.\n\nAnd for those who can&apos;t keep up with historical jokes, there&apos;s the Black Knight, Tim, and Zoot to keep you occupied. They sure as hell make me laugh.\n\nSo if you like daft humour, go for it! But promise to check out the subtle jokes as well. It&apos;s worth the effort, and you&apos;ll learn a little about history too."

            "reviewBody": "I think this is possibly Miyazaki&apos;s most intriguing movie. All of his other films are very linear and even though their highly varied worlds may be visually stunning and highly creative, I feel the dreamy world of Howls Moving Castle is by far the most captivating, bizarre, and imaginative of all the worlds Miyazaki has ever envisioned.\n\nWhat I love about this movie is that it&apos;s highly emotional without a great deal of logic or plot or story to get in the way. In this way the film is simple, pure, and extremely beautiful. It is as if the characters go from one emotion to the next, in a world that is as random as one&apos;s own dreams. Some people have complained about the lack of plot or story or serious character development, but even though the characters are fairly static, their emotions and the physical changes they undergo as they go through these emotions brings out a higher truth that is seldom given such artistic and natural freedom.\n\nI think this is a very smart movie in many subtle ways and it&apos;s one that I look forward to watching again on the big screen and then on DVD. Although it flirts from theme to theme to theme with a kind of animated attention deficit disorder, the landscapes and utter unabated surrealism left me stunned and never bored.\n\nAlso, from a quizzical character design perspective, Howl is certainly one of if not the most beautiful characters that Miyazaki has ever created. Howl is an interesting departure from Miyazaki&apos;s more classical wabi-sabi anime style that most of his heroes and heroines are drawn in as Howl is definitely a very contemporary bishonen.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for quaint settings, dynamic characters and a very involving character or plot driven story, you&apos;re not going to necessarily find them here, but you will find an equally stunning and pleasing movie if you let yourself go and enjoy this passionate, heartfelt and surreal Miyazaki dream.",

Sadly, that&apos;s what makes it fiction too. But it&apos;s nice to dream.\n\nThe fact that the title character, and the character that inspires all the change, is the ultimate &quot;other&quot; only serves to make the point more elegantly.\n\nI suppose some people will think it&apos;s manipulative and needlessly tugs at the audience&apos;s heartstrings.

To see someone so beautiful, dignified, and unique, hidden behind a body and face that society considers ugly, made me realize how the body is a decaying pile of dust, but the soul is a breath-taking and uniquely formed indestructible diamond.\n\nI believe that everyone should get a chance to see this film, for those of an open mind, and a caring soul, there is nothing else like it.\n\nIt also shows the detestable ways some people treat others. I felt at first pity for John Merrick, but then my feelings changed to admiration, as the film went on. John, in the film starts as a severely deformed mute figure being badly mistreated, as the story progresses, he becomes the hero. A bold and courageous man, standing against the  evils of modern society.\n\nJoseph (John) Merrick, was a man so one-of-a-kind, that someone else like him physically or emotionally will never appear again. His life should be taken as an example to everyone.\n\nAs in the film, John&apos;s mother says &quot;Nothing will Die&quot;, Joseph Merrick will live on in the hearts and souls of everyone who has witnessed the story of his life.\n\nMy love goes to Joseph Merrick, where ever he may be.",

            "reviewBody": "There is a lot to admire about Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;Dial M for Murder,&quot; and I do hold the film with a great deal of admiration and respect. However, what I adore about the movie the most (more than the cinematography, the suspense, the acting, and even the direction) is the work by screenwriter Frederick Knott. Mr. Knott based the screenplay for &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; on his successful stage production, which I have never seen, but am told contains almost all of the words we hear in the film. And the words are music to the ears. They sing with intelligence, wit that Mr. Hitchcock certainly found attractive, and, best of all, an easy transition to the screen. Many times when a stage production goes to film, as far as I am concerned, the results, even if good, are uneven. Frequently, the dialogue and restricted set space allowed tend to give off the impression of a filmed play, not a cinematic experience. Another Hitchcock film, 1948&apos;s &quot;Rope,&quot; though valiant, interesting, and successful, attempted this and suffered from this difficult struggle.\n\nBut the dialogue, put on film here, is exceptional. I write this review having seen &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; two or three times and wanting to see it once again. Many reviewers, myself included, have tried watching films with the sound off. I want to try the opposite. I want to close my eyes and just listen to the dialogue because it&apos;s so strong. The MacGuffin conversation at the beginning, with a perfectly cast Ray Milland blackmailing a perfectly cast Anthony Dawson into murdering a perfectly cast Grace Kelly is brilliantly written by Mr. Knott. It was clearly from a stage production, as it explains the plot background in great detail, and goes on for the better part of twenty minutes. Both men are fleshed out, giving us their personalities and individual tendencies. And even though &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; pretty much stays on just one small set (an apartment in London, in which we see mostly the foyer, a little of the bedroom, and just a glimpse of the kitchen), what happens there is so fascinating that we do not really want to venture out into the city.\n\nAnd that is just the setup. The dialogue remains insistently interesting and clever throughout the picture. It also has that subtle, dark sense of humor that Alfred Hitchcock was keen on. It also has the ironic touches, such as when Mr. Milland, as the jealous husband, kisses his unfaithful wife on the night she is to be murdered, and tells her: &quot;Goodbye, my dear.&quot; The audience, having been given every single little detail about the scheme and how it is to unfold, cringes with a dark realization that Mr. Hitchcock might just go through with Mr. Milland&apos;s plot. Mr. Hitchcock, as the director, is also due tremendous credit for his trademark of creating tension. Screenwriter Knott brilliantly lays out for the audience, not the victim, how the murder will go through, but Mr. Hitchcock&apos;s camera dutifully follows everything as the scheme goes along. And, before we realize it, if something starts to go wrong, we become scared and tense. And you can imagine my guilt when I realized I was feeling scared that a plan to murder someone just might not go through. It&apos;s Mr. Hitchcock&apos;s gift at work.\n\nDimitri Tiomkin, a very good film composer, hits all the write notes; that includes knowing when he needs to tell his violins and trumpets to shut up. Robert Burks&apos; cinematography is also strong with effective usage of shadows and streaks of light. Colors are omnipresent. And even though &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; was shot with the intent to be seen in 3D, it is hardly evident. When I first saw the film, in much superior 2D, I did not mind the lamps and such in the foreground, such as when one bisects the screen between Ray Milland and Anthony Dawson during the opening sequence. I just thought it was a clever piece of filmmaking and misc en scene, not a cheap gimmick like in most 3D movies today. &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; is a near-perfect movie of its kind, pumped full of smart dialogue and dazzling energy. This is one of the few play-to-movie transition that I have seen where I have suddenly become eager to see the original stage production.",

People prefer to live a lie than admit the truth, very reminiscent of today&apos;s world. The characters are talking to us, we are the jury.\n\nThe performances are amazing, nothing acting is so good, blows away today&apos;s competition.\n\nThe film score is stunning as well, one of my favourites from a Japanese film.\n\nThe direction is breathtaking, the jungle is beautifully lit, it has a sense of horror to it. Black and white was the perfect choice.\n\nOverall, an amazing film from a genius!"

It&apos;s a very long novel, and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending. It&apos;s a good read, but Margaret Mitchell, former newspaper reporter, is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it. It&apos;s the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick. Not what parts to film, but which parts to leave out. So many characters that appeared in the book couldn&apos;t be introduced in the movie without extending the film&apos;s length to well over four hours. So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay, then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script, and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed. Selznick was close to running out of money, so he asked his angel, millionaire Jock Whitney, to loan him enough to finish the film. The film was finally completed and edited, then was test-marketed at a theatre not far from LA. The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards, which allowed Selznick to rest easy, knowing he had a hit on his hands.",

It starts with a story of complexity but accessibility. Nicholson&apos;s Jake Gittes, running around with a slit in the side of his nose, put there by Polanski, investigates, gets careless, and realizes what he has stumbled upon. Fay Dunaway as Mrs. Mulray and John Huston and that voice: &quot;Just find the girl.&quot; There are comic scenes and Nicholson has feet of clay, but he finally puts his personal integrity on the line. He moves into darkness and sees the underside. And then there is Chinatown with its secrets, politics, incest, all of that. It is such an intelligent movies. One of the reviewers said it was compact. That says it all. Every scene is necessary. It&apos;s too bad Polanski can&apos;t work in the U.S. anymore--he still releases a treasures every so often. To get back to the movie, all that leads to the climactic last several minutes has been prepared for with loving care by the director. It&apos;s so nice to know that there are films like this that people will watch into the latter stages of the 21st century. One of finest.",

I didn&apos;t expect to like it so much, so I owe a review to those in analysis measures before seeing it or those interested in some opinion.\n\nFirst off, Campanella works with flawless effort all of the technical aspects of the film. It even starts with a double exposure effect, mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful Buenos Aires that hints the spectacle ahead of us. One shot especially, from a chopper in a soccer field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking. Nothing to envy from Hollywood upper class.\n\nBut the main strength of the movie comes from the powerful narrative dominion Director Campanella has over characters, spaces and silences. Many moments are coldly tense, scary and very, very intense. This crossover from genres by Campanella couldn&apos;t have been better. Crime stories often fall in common places, this one relies on the fragile psychological state of the audience to draw all of it&apos;s intense dialog, acting and scenes.\n\nI cannot stop recommending it, Argentina can open it&apos;s market with movies such as this. It has many, many memorable moments, it interwines comedy perfectly and it is doubtful you will instantly forget it, as it is so well constructed. See it if you can!",

            "reviewBody": "I was a total and complete sucker for this film.\n\nIf I were to write and direct a movie about gangsters or crime, this would be it.  I wouldn&apos;t change one damn thing.  Not a thing.  Everything in this film was, to my eye, perfect - casting, the camerawork, the excellent dialogue (&quot;It&apos;s been emotional.&quot;)\n\nNow I don&apos;t have much to compare this to, and I&apos;ve heard some criticism that it basically draws quite heavily from older British crime dramas.  I&apos;ve got a bunch of these on my queue to rent, but I doubt you could make a crime film better than this.\n\nThis film oozes with style, class, dark humor, plot twists and turns, and doesn&apos;t drag one bit.  The casting and characterization is perfect, and Ritchie isn&apos;t afraid to move the cameras around; no pretense is really made here at &quot;realism&quot; - Ritchie doesn&apos;t mask the fact that it&apos;s a film and he runs with it.\n\nI really don&apos;t think of myself as easily impressed, and I have seen a hell of a lot of films in my time, but this one instantly made my Top 10 after only a single viewing.  Yes, I&apos;m raving about it, and while it may not be &quot;spiritually enriching&quot; or contain any deep sociological content (which I actually do look for in films), somehow it still scores as one hell of a film; memorable and entertaining, and stands up well to multiple viewings.\n\nI am a bit dismayed to see some of the marketing of this film comparing it to other things like Quentin Tarantino films or Trainspotting.  It really does it a disservice because this film really is its own phenomenon and stands on its own two feet; if anything it is similar to  Trainspotting and Tarantino films only because it actually has its own bold style.\n\nCan&apos;t recommend it enough.",

            "reviewBody": "I was a fan of the &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; graphic novel, and Alan Moore disinheriting the film was a bit discouraging. But he&apos;s always been a little crazy. The film version is everything I could have possibly hoped for - gripping, chilling, intense, exciting, heartbreaking. It gets Moore&apos;s music if not his exact words; elements are slightly different, subplots removed. But the idea - as V himself would be so proud to say - remains the same.\n\nThe plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced, and I don&apos;t want to give anything more away than the previews already have. Suffice it to say that a masked anarchist (voiced by Hugo Weaving) must save a young woman (Natalie Portman) during his attempt to expose corruption in the government. Weaving is perfectly cast, using his formidable physicality and imposing voice to give gravitas to the insanity of the character. Portman has gone from child to teen star and is finally emerging as a talented, adult actress following her Oscar-nominated turn in &quot;Closer&quot;. Here, she gives her best performance to date as the orphan Evey. John Hurt is characteristically impressive as the enigmatic government leader, and Stephen Rea gives a wonderful supporting turn as the police inspector charged with finding V - before it&apos;s too late.\n\nThe Wachowski Brothers&apos; former protégé, James McTiegue, takes on the directing duties here and helms an enormously impressive first feature, using every trick in the book in a manner reminiscent of his mentors&apos; breakout hit &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Unlike &quot;The Matrix&quot;, McTiegue allows the story to be more of a focus than the action, and as a result the film is a tense and emotional thriller, with outbursts of spectacularly filmed and choreographed action. Showing more maturity and restraint than the Wachowskis, McTiegue doesn&apos;t show off, and his trickery isn&apos;t self conscious. When slow-motion overtakes a late action sequence, it seems as natural as breathing. The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle (the film is dedicated to his memory) does an outstanding job, Oscar-nominated Dario Marianelli&apos;s score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece, and the visual effects are astonishing, terrifying, and deeply moving, especially in the climatic moments in Trafalgar Square.\n\nWith solid acting, great action, and fantastic technical wizardry, it sounds just like another &quot;Matrix&quot;-style ripoff. But the biggest difference in &quot;V&quot; is that it is a story of real ideas - not a fantastic, science fiction creation, but a genuine examination of the human condition. The power of fear takes center stage here - the fear of war, of disease, of famine. Fear is a basic human nature, and has been exploited as a weapon - a method of control - for centuries. And for those who would use it, a masked man waits in the shadows to carry out your sentence. The verdict? Vengeance. &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; is a must-see.\n\n10/10"

            "reviewBody": "For some reason, I couldn&apos;t quite catch this movie in theaters and I managed to watch it on an international flight. And boy, am I glad I did! \n\nAs far as concepts go, I was astonished at the amount of detail and coherence in execution. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the colors rich and vibrant, the characters utterly memorable and some of the most poignantly heart-breaking lines of dialogue ever spoken/sung in any movie, let alone feature animation. It is every bit a Disney-Pixar classic and as emphatic a return to form as it can get.\n\nThe story revolves around a young girl child who is happy in her world and has to suddenly acclimatize to another environment when her family has to move. Growing pains and social issues affect her while she grapples with increasingly complex situations, both at home and school. Meanwhile, the interplay between the five primary emotions inside her mind is both dynamic and fraught with compromises, much like how we deal with others everyday. As things come to a head and young Riley is about to make a life-changing decision, the events that follow leave a lasting impression, with an increased appreciation of the phrase &quot;emotions are what makes us human&quot;! \n\nI recognized some dichotomies - for instance, Minnesota, usually perceived cold, is regarded as warm and comforting by Riley while San Francisco, renowned for its sunny weather, is seen as foreign and unwelcome. The other contrast I noticed was all five emotional figures (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust) do not always stay true to form, with Joy especially exhibiting nuances far beyond what her name implies - case in point, her touching admission preceding the last act (that entire sequence was too much for my eyes to take, by the way). All this might be considered a tad too much for young children to appreciate, but with time, they may probably realize how beautifully honest this movie was in trying to portray their growth and the underlying issues.\n\nCertainly, it is not without flaws: the plot meandered a bit 2/3rds into the length; Joy&apos;s &quot;A-ha&quot; moment seems strangely contrived, despite the impact it had; the music was adequate but not truly captivating as in the case of other Pixar offerings. But the beauty of this medium is that it offers filmmakers opportunities to steer audiences to more engaging experiences; Pete Docter and Co accomplish this with aplomb.\n\nIn terms of cast and crew, the voice actors are superb selections - Lewis Black aces the Angry persona with generous dollops of sarcasm; Mindy Kaling is just perfect voicing Disgust; Richard Kind&apos;s performance as the imaginary Bing Bong is an absolute tear-jerker, while Kaitlyn Dias shows remarkable poise playing Riley. But it is Amy Poehler who steals the show in a coruscating blend of vivacity, vibrancy, and vicariousness. Her Joy is not an infallible leader, but one who accepts others in the face of challenging situations and plows ahead with inspiring positive energy. The animation left me spell-bound, especially the sequence where thoughts are shown to be abstracted, and are endowed with a lot of heart. The movie is fairly short, but a running time of 94 minutes is appropriate justice to a slightly heavy subject matter. The humor compensates with trademark Pixar staple of jokes, albeit intended for slightly more mature viewers. Pete Docter gave us the outstanding Up six years ago and ably accompanied by Ronnie del Carmen, has categorically demonstrated that he is a fabulous storyteller and a master entertainer.\n\nInside Out is every bit a Pixar fan&apos;s well-deserved reward for patience. Do yourself a favor and watch this magnificent gem.",

            "reviewBody": "Saw &apos;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&apos; on the promise of one of the year&apos;s best trailers, the immensely talented cast, the intriguing subject matter, the receiving and pending of numerous accolades and being familiar with Martin McDonagh&apos;s previous work. \n\nOn the most part &apos;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&apos; was incredibly well done. Understandably it is not for all. The film has already been criticised for implausibility, bigotry, the ending and its lack of character likeability and over-the-top actions, though often without acknowledging the film&apos;s many strengths and resorting to condescension (a big bugbear of mine) towards people who liked it let alone loved it. \n\nDid have a couple of issues with &apos;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&apos; myself. The ending is far too abrupt and without resolution in a film crying out for one. \n\nEpileptics should beware too of a dizzyingly edited attempted murder scene, understand why it was edited that way but will admit that it did make me feel ill watching it (luckily it quickly passed). \n\nAbbie Cornish felt out of place here, she doesn&apos;t have a lot to do (not enough to single handedly ruin the film, she would have to have a far more major role to do that) but everything about her just jarred. \n\nThere are some implausible behaviours and consequences, Dixon&apos;s actions were more than just a sackable offense for instance.\n\nHowever, there is so much to like about &apos;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&apos;. With the sole exception of Cornish, who isn&apos;t in it enough to ruin the film, the acting is brilliant. Frances McDormand&apos;s performance is a career high and one of the year&apos;s best, very heartfelt and fiery, even if you don&apos;t condone some of her actions it is hard not to feel for her as she goes through every mother&apos;s worst nightmare. Woody Harrelson is heart-breaking and has the film&apos;s most sympathetic character perhaps (either he or Peter Dinklage&apos;s, although Dinklage doesn&apos;t have the film&apos;s most tragic scene). \n\nSam Rockwell is similarly a revelation, you initially dislike his character but later on his 180 is incredibly moving and he is the character who changes and redeems the most. Peter Dinklage always makes anything better and it&apos;s the same here just by his presence alone and his performance is the most likeable one, especially towards the end where one actually feels sorry for him. \n\nAnother standout is the writing, do not let the heavy use of profanity put you off. There are parts that are darkly comic and induce a number of chuckles and laugh out louds. The film also works as being one that is morally nuanced and complex, the characters are not &quot;likeable&quot; ones, neither were they intended to be, and make questionable decisions but they undergo changes that sees them in a different perspective (Dixon especially). \n\nA large part of me found it difficult to not relate to Mildred, her actions are extreme at times but there are parents in the same situation that feel similarly seeing as grief is an incredibly powerful and complex emotion. It&apos;s the tragic elements that resonate most though, with its heavy going themes handled very poignantly and harrowingly. &apos;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&apos; has a story that is deliberate but also gripping, with an adept balance of its varied tones. Which is why it is sad that it ends as unsatisfyingly as it does. \n\nWith the exception of one scene, &apos;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&apos; is succinctly edited and grittily and beautifully shot. McDonagh directs very skilfully. Carter Burwell&apos;s music score fits perfectly and is a hypnotic, understated and melancholic score in its own right. Just as fitting in a somewhat ironic way is the use of the gorgeous &quot;Last Rose of Summer&quot; exquisitely sung by Renee Fleming, whose voice one familiar with and loves classical music and opera (like me) recognises from anywhere. \n\nOverall, gripping and very well done film if not perfect. The performances are among the best of the year especially but the film itself as an overall whole just falls a tad short of being one of the year&apos;s best films. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

This not a boxing movie per se but a character study of a near pshcotic pugilist.  THis guy is just overflowing with testosterone and has a severly unbalanced mental state.  Any thing that gets in his way he promptly smashes.  Raging bull is a study of male rage which knows no bounds.  Jake La Motta has a massive inferiority complex which drives him to the heights of brutality. IN the ring, Jake is the pride of his neighborhood. Outside the ring however he hurts his family and friends.  He wants to maintain control over his wife and does so through bullying and phsical abuse.  He realizes she is the better person and feels she must be having an affair whenever he is away. His performance in the ring takes away from his sex life with her.  HE cannot lose control of the things he feels he has a right to.  In the end who loses everything; his wife his brother&apos;s support, and his status as a boxer.  WIth age his violent passions subdued in part by his great weight he becomes a mere shadow of his former self. In closing this is a brilliant picture that should have swept the 1980 academy awards.  One of my alltime top ten."

            "reviewBody": "The Bridge on the River Kwai – David Lean&apos;s first epic, a genre he would later be associated with more than any other. Previously having made his mark as a director of deep and often psychological dramas, Lean&apos;s easy transition into bigger pictures reflects the change that was taking place in the genre itself, moving from the grandiose spectacle of De Mille et al, towards the &quot;intimate&quot; epic of the late 50s and early 60s.\n\nWe are also here seeing the development of the war, or rather, the anti-war picture. Prior to this most anti-war or anti-military pictures were small-scale dramas, whereas all the big war films were rousing flag wavers. Bridge on the River Kwai ticks both boxes, and is all the more effective for it. It is an anti-war film which prevents itself from becoming static or preachy, and an action film with a humanist edge.\n\nThe problem presented to David Lean, aside from the fact that he had never done anything on this scale before, is that Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman&apos;s multi-layered screenplay contains many different strands, with stories told from multiple points of view. Lean fortunately had dealt with such fragmentary narratives before – 1952&apos;s The Sound Barrier for example – and here he actually uses the trappings of the epic to keep the narrative focused. This was the first time he had used the cinemascope aspect ratio, but rather than employing it purely to show off the stunning landscapes (although he does do a fair bit of that too, and why not?) he also uses the width of the screen to cram varying elements into the frame. For example, in the scene where Nicholson (Alec Guinness) surveys the railway construction with his fellow officers, the figure of Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) can be seen on a hill in the background. This reminds us of his presence, and subtly keeps his story arc going.\n\nLean&apos;s use of colour is also remarkable. Of course, when your film is set in a PoW camp in the middle of a jungle, you have a fairly limited colour palette anyway, but Lean&apos;s crafty choice of camera angle and positioning is calculated to show off different tones at different times. In the opening moments, highly reminiscent of The African Queen (which, like Kwai, was produced by Sam Spiegel) he begins with the greens of the jungle – a fairly cold colour. As we descend through the trees, Lean gradually turns up the heat with those dusty yellows and browns. For the middle section of the film, he cools things off again with more lush greens and even some vibrant shades, before returning to the stark hot tones for the tense finale. Again, this is all very subtle director&apos;s work, but these touches do create little shifts in mood and influence the way we view each scene.\n\nLean&apos;s handling of the larger canvas was however not yet quite up to best showing off his actors upon it. That&apos;s a shame with such a good cast, although Alec Guinness in one of his earliest non-comedic roles shone through enough to garner an Oscar. William Holden was also deserving of at least a nomination, but didn&apos;t get one. To my mind though the best performance of the picture was that of Sessue Hayakawa. Hayakawa was an incredibly powerful silent film actor – check him out in De Mille&apos;s The Cheat (1915) – and it&apos;s great to see him at the top of his game again here.\n\nBombarded with awards, Bridge on the River Kwai is typical Oscar-winning fare, particularly for the conflicted political climate of the 1950s. It can be read as a damning critique of war, but also enjoyed as a gripping action film. This broad appeal, the depth of the screenplay and Lean&apos;s assured direction made it a hit in its day and allowed its popularity to endure in the generations since.",

The film is full of memorable moments such as the chase down Edinburgh&apos;s Princes Street which opens the film (I happened to be there when they were filming that scene) and Ewan McGregor diving down the &quot;Worst Toilet in Scotland&quot; headfirst.\n\nThe film doesn&apos;t condemn drug addicts, but it is probably more effective then any amount of preachy moralising as it depicts the devastating consequences that can happen to drug users.  \n\nThe film is well acted by a cast who have (mostly) become pretty famous since.  Especially memorable is Robert Carlyle as the violent Begbie.\n\nI have seen this film many times.  It is an instant classic.  Go check it out."

            "reviewBody": "At first I thought I was going to see a lightweight film from a great director but instead I watched another impressive achievement by Steven Spielberg. A few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. Leonardo Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he&apos;s someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; and his mere presence adds more to this film. The sign of a great film star. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. The last scene of him as he talks to his son in the restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of Walken. You can understand why Dicaprio admires and loves his father. Walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately. I&apos;ll be rooting for him at Oscar time. Another impressive thing about this film is the beautiful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who&apos;s a real artist with a camera and has worked on several Spielberg films. One shot in particular stands out. The ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window on Walken. Very thought provoking. And of course since its a Spielberg film its very personal. Spielberg was interested in the Frank Abagnale character because as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to be someone else. Spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that he worked there. Also, the real Frank Abagnale jr. appears as a French police officer. Well made, extremely well acted and sharply written. Viewers seem to forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family and the aftermath. This really is a personal film from Spielberg, and a very good one.",

            "reviewBody": "Fargo is a great piece of movie. It has a strong story and a strong cast. It&apos;s down to earth and believable.\n\nJerry Lundegaard is in some trouble. He hires two small time crocks from Fargo to kidnap his wife. The plan is for her father to pay off and for Jerry to take the money. Things don&apos;t exactly goes as planned as they kill three people and get a pregnant Chief on their tail.\n\nThe Coen brothers have does a terrific job on this movie. It&apos;s a well written, original story with an original setting and it doesn&apos;t try to be anything it isn&apos;t. Just a few characters, a simple plot and small scale. They stay away of clichés and don&apos;t even remotely try to mix in anything of that regular Hollywood crap. They manage to capture the mood, the people and the action pretty good. The characters are great, they&apos;re reasonable and believable. They manage to keep it serious, but not too serious and put inn a joke here and there.\n\nThe actors are great. They way they manage to put on a happy smile and make it seem polite and a little, but not all too false in a great way. William H. Macy is great as Jerry Lundegaard. He gives a little nervous, kind of boy scout performance and it fits perfect. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare makes two great small time losers. Buscemi is great as a small, funny looking, constant talking bad guy and Stormare fits the big silent, violent, psychopath type really good and they act these characters all the way out. Kristin Rudrüd does a good job as Jean Lundegaard and Harve Presnell as the rich dad is always a winner.\n\nThe cinematography is good. All of the shots are good looking and some of them are original, cool and extra good looking. All of the shots are well composed, the lightning is good, but not much out of the ordinary. There are a nice play with the colors in some shots involving the snow.\n\nThe score is really nice. The theme is a little sad and so is the movie. It&apos;s moody and supports the action and fits the settings very well. It&apos;s used in a classical way between the action and that works very well, it makes the action seem more real and more close.\n\nFargo is a original movie out of the ordinary. The story is good, well written and it&apos;s well brought to life and captured. The Coen brothers has made a timeless and very enjoyable movie. See it!",

No matter what.\n\nJoel was perfect in the role as a passionate, loving and fierce boxer and family man. Hardy was also great in the little convulated army-disgraced man who just wanted to do right by his fallen comrade. Nick Nolte did most of the magic with his eyes. And the last 20 minutes of the movie can make any grown man AND woman cry.\n\nCheers.",

I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn&apos;t feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don&apos;t want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!\n\nBRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.\n\nGo see this movie!"

            "reviewBody": "If Clint Eastwood had retired after Gran Torino, it might have been one of the most perfect endings to an iconic actor&apos;s career. Walt Kowalski is like Harry Callahan or number of Eastwood characters from his past only, like the vessel they&apos;re protrayed through, older. He&apos;s the crusty, cynical tough-guy who deep inside is a bit softer and has a warmer than you&apos;d expect heart. Which is the truth we see revealed in Kowalski over the course of this movie as he befriends and helps the Hmong kid next door. There might be enough of these movies to constitute an entire subgenre of friendship films: one involving an older guy who learns a little about life while teaching a boy to be a man. It&apos;s a friendship story and even what you&apos;d call a feel-good one despite the violence and negativity surrounding it. The film aims for authenticity though I think bits of it will be seen by posterity as dated, false hollywood depictions.\n\nMaybe the later movies kept him busy but this is where Eastwood&apos;s career as an actor should have (and in a sense did) end.",

Overwhelmed by the simple truth of its conclusion. My hat to Clint Eastwood. What an extraordinary career. An artist of enormous proportions so well camouflaged behind a shy smile and a charming, clumsy attitude. I remember focusing on Clint Eastwood through a very different lens after sitting through &quot;Pale Rider&quot; a mythological, lyrical western. Actors love him because he, clearly, doesn&apos;t lie to them, doesn&apos;t kiss their asses. He quite simply gives them room to maneuver. Even someone like Meryl Streep, felt freer and capable to stretch herself all the way to Italy under his wing. Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Jude Law, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman yes mostly men but there was also, other than Meryl Streep, Genevieve Boujold. Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney and now Hillary Swank with a performance that not even &quot;Boys don&apos;t Cry&quot; could predict. The film is a triumph in every department. My stomach ached from feeling. That&apos;s a compliment Mr. Eastwood. Thank you very much.",

Suddenly, he stops at My Neighbor Totoro and smiles.  Well, that&apos;s a pretty typical happenning around the house here.\n\nMiyazaki created a true masterpiece with this film.  It has everything a person, of any age, could want.  There are points that it is hilarious, a few points where it makes one slightly nervous, the animation is outstanding (as with all Miyazaki films), and aside from lacking a little bit in plot (what movie doesn&apos;t nowadays?), the story is wonderful.\n\nOne of the things that makes this film shine, at least for me, is that there is absolutely no antagonist role.  No bad guy whatsoever, and only a genius like Miyazaki could pull that off.\n\nIs this a childrens movie?  Yes, of course it is.  Is it a movie only for children?  Well...  maybe for the inner child inside all of us.  There&apos;s humour in this movie that the young will laugh at, and there&apos;s a bit of humour in the movie that only adults will fully catch and appreciate, without it being &quot;adult humour&quot;.\n\nI would reccommend, and have reccommended this film to anyone that would listen.\n\nThank you again Miyazaki Sensei.",

It&apos;s a film that has a simple plot and premise but is heavy on pretty much everything else from dedicated actors sinking into the madly written lines and plot, gorgeous cinematography, an excellent audio score and the excellent use of practical effects. Seriously it uses such a blend of practical effects within special effects that compliment each other so well you start to believe they&apos;re actually in these crazy chase sequences including a ridiculous one through a live sand storm that was wicked to watch unfold. My only complaints would be it could have used a little more complex plot and Max himself could have been in the movie more as a protagonist instead of feeling like a supporting character in a movie with his name in the title. Other than that it&apos;s a wild ride from start to finish with almost near non stop action to keep you invested until the climactic, while partially abrupt, finish.",

            "reviewBody": "Some movies are so good that they just haven&apos;t age. They are timeless, like any work of art. This is one of those movies, perhaps one of the best movies ever and surely one of the biggest and most epic biblical movies ever made. The story is based on a novel by Lew Wallace (which I have read and I have at home) and is so famous that it doesn&apos;t allow spoils: the injustice committed against Judah Ben-Hur and his path of revenge, deeply linked to the life and death of Jesus, a latent and ever palpable subplot, even when it does not arise. Epic in every detail, the film features scenarios and costumes carefully crafted in the style of Imperial Rome. Some sequences are truly anthological, as is the case with the chariot race. The representation of the Roman legionaries influenced for decades the conception that we have, individually, on how they were and fought. The visual and special effects used in the film were the best there was at the time and even today, more than half a century later, they&apos;re able to surprise by the realism. The color is vivid and intense, cinematography is truly imposing and accentuates the epic ambiance. As for the cast&apos;s work, it&apos;s definitely the movie of Charlton Heston&apos;s life. He not only became famous with it but made here the most remarkable character of his career. Steven Boyd, Jack Hawkins, Haya Harareet, Martha Scott and Hugh Griffith also shone. It&apos;s a long movie, but the audience gets so caught up in it that they don&apos;t even feel the time go by. Wonderful!",

            "reviewBody": "Directed by Steve McQueen and staring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict CUmberbatch, newcomer Lupita Nyong&apos;o, and a ton of other stars, &apos;12 Years a Slave&apos; is based on the memoir of Solomon Northup, a freeman who was living in Saratoga, NY before being tricked, drugged, and sold into slavery in the south.\n\nMcQueen is an auteur known for his honest and brutal direction, and he keeps filming when others would shut the camera off or look away. While making the picture that much more difficult to sit through, his steadfastness greatly elevates the emotional impact of the film. It&apos;s a must-see, if only for educational purposes—just as &apos;Schindler&apos;s List&apos; is used to teach about the Holocaust and &apos;Milk&apos; about the struggle for gay rights. \n\nI&apos;m not trying to compare the events depicted in this film with the events depicted in those I just mentioned, all I&apos;m saying is that they are all equally important in portraying the reality of their respective situations. There is a moment in &apos;12 Years a Slave&apos; when, as a form of punishment, Northup is hanged by his neck, the tips of his toes just able to reach the ground below him. The camera stays on him for a few minutes. It is silent, and all you can do is listen to him struggling for breath. \n\nThis is one of the more disturbing moments in the film, but not the worst. Eventually, Northup is sold to Edwin Epps, a short-tempered and impulsive plantation owner portrayed by Michael Fassbender. He is by far the most villainous and terrifying character in the film, and Fassbender brilliantly captures his mood swings and tempestuous personality. \n\nIt is Chiwetel Ejiofor, however, who steals the show. He brings so much life to Northup, and completely disappears into his characters. He is able to depict so many deep levels of emotion, while also bringing dignity to a man who was unwilling to let anyone take away his will to &quot;live&quot; rather than just &quot;survive.&quot; Additionally, Lupita Nyong&apos;o, in her first big film role, is mesmerizing as Patsey, and hardworking and desperate woman, and the object of her master Epps&apos;s attention. She is hated by Epps&apos;s wife—masterfully played by Sarah Paulson— and most of the more dramatic moments in the film revolve around her character&apos;s tragic story. \n\nIf I have one complaint, it&apos;s that 12 years do not seem to pass by at all, mainly because none of the characters substantially age. Also, Brad Pitt is thrown in for ten minutes to depict a kind-hearted abolitionist, and while he does a good job, it just feels like Brad Pitt on a slave plantation, which is totally out of place. \n\nRegardless, while the film may be harrowing and difficult to sit through, it is simply brilliant all the way through, and by far the most honest depiction of slavery that I&apos;ve ever seen.",

            "reviewBody": "Some movies - I wish there were more of them - simply look like a series of great paintings. This film has that look. You could freeze-frame many of the scenes and swear you were looking at a Gainsborough, a Vermeer, a Hogarth or similar work of art by one the great artists of three to five centuries ago. It&apos;s just beautiful.\n\nFor that, we have Director Stanley Kubrick and Photographer John Alcott to thank. Being a three-hour movie, there are plenty of wonderful shots to admire, too. In addition, the costumes are lavish and authentic and the scoring is notable. It&apos;s no accident that Oscars were garnered for art/set direction, cinematography, costume design and scoring. Yeah, if you enjoy classical music, you&apos;ll really enjoy the soundtrack, too, under the guidance of conductor Leonard Roseman.\n\nNot to be overlooked is the fine acting and the interesting and underrated story. I say &quot;underrated&quot; because this film, from what I&apos;ve read, bored a lot of people and and it was a box-office flop. That&apos;s too bad because, frankly, I found the story (outside of the first 10--15 minutes) to be fascinating. As I watched, I kept wondering what strange occurrences will happen next to the lead character, &quot;Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon,&quot; played beautifully by Ryan O&apos;Neal. (For most of the movie, he&apos;s called &quot;Redmond Barry,&quot; so I will refer to him as that.) \n\nOverall, this was a low-key adventure story about the rise-and-fall of a &quot;scoundrel&quot; back in late 18th century Englishman. &quot;Mr. Barry&quot; is an Irishmen living in England who winds up dealing with a number of people: Irish, English, Prussian, French. His dealings with these people are bizarre at times. While he mainly is shown doing what he can to promote himself, for either monetary gain and prestige of a name and power, he&apos;s not all bad. There is a compassionate side to him, but it only shows itself in small doses. It makes him all the more interesting to watch, because you don&apos;t always know how he&apos;s going to react to his circumstances, which change radically every few years.\n\nWe witness his rise to prominence and then his fall when his &quot;sins begin to find him out,&quot; as the Bible would describe. It&apos;s quite a roller coaster ride.\n\nThis is an emotional, involving story, and a feast for the eyes and ears. It&apos;s quite different, too, certainly not the average fare from Kubrick. I can only hope this comes out on a high-definition disc some day. Admirers of this film need to see this in all its glory.",

            "reviewBody": "This is simply Scott&apos;s finest hour. There are a sheer plethora of futuristic films with vision. Films which crudely grope into a possible time ahead,when perhaps a post apocalyptic era is scattered with cliché upon cliché and often miss the whole point. What Ridley Scott achieved with this film,is an entirely possible scenario. It really does feel like a science fiction novel brought to life,but not so much as its derivative penned by Phillip K Dick(do androids dream of electric sheep?). Its a grimy,violent world inhabited by the sick,lower class,villainous second citizens who haven&apos;t quite made the grade for the off world colonies. We have a true smelting pot of nationalities.The heavy eastern references within china town like inner cities is particularly poignant.\n\nThis film also sees Ford in perfect casting.Theirs a rye charm that Ford has that no other actor could fake or fill quite as effortlessly. Its a mixed review depending on what version you have seen. For me,the directors cut is simply too cut. I preferred the audience friendly screening which had the wonderful narration. The finest moment with this narration has to be the moments described by Batty in his dying eyes and the summing up by Ford of this man/machines passion and love for life.. No other sci-fi futuristic film has ever made the grade before or since in my humble opinion. It captured the raw smells and light of a brutal future scarily depicted in films or even so well. From the chase scene with Zora to the flybys over the city capturing a stunning skyline,chimneys and skyscrapers in one shot. This is my favourite movie of all time for all the reasons above and many more i could effortlessly type all day and night."

The story also relies heavily on dialogue. It has some parallels to Lost in Translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and simply a lot better.\n\nThe script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliantly. Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together.\n\nThe dialogue moves into very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little over the top. It does, however, stay on the right side almost all the time, although I found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing. Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors. Sometimes, it yields great results, and overall this movie is simply stupendous! Only very, very rarely is &quot;love&quot; in films depicted in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic. Every time that is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect. She still looks stunning in this film, 12 years after.\n\nThis is simply a gem of a movie that you can&apos;t miss. One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s!",

Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, with terrific cameos by Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Jude Law and others I feel bad for forgetting here. \n\nWhile not Anderson&apos;s most profound film, it may be his most joyful. I don&apos;t think I stopped smiling from first frame to last, and I laughed out loud quite a few times. And yet, as in any good fable, there is some real poignancy as well. A top notch marriage of a lovingly crafted art-film and a wacky human comedy, something rarely pulled off with such panache. Even my friends who don&apos;t enjoy Anderson&apos;s work in general had nothing but good things to say. The sweetest treat of the movie year so far.",

Why? In the moment he appears, this extraordinary film becomes a movie. It took me completely out of it. When you look at him you see an actor, acting. On the other hand, Andrew Garfield. Sublime. He makes totally believable a character that could be fictional. The humanity in Andrew Garfield&apos;s eyes makes everything real. It tells us, in no uncertain terms, that at the very center of it all, there is love. Love!",

            "reviewBody": "... and yet it has grown on me to where it is one of my favorites.\n\nWhen I first saw this in the theater I felt disappointed and baited and switched. Robin Williams may be top billed, but he is not the center of the film although he is the motivating character. He is a new teacher at an elite private school for boys that has traditions that probably nobody remembers the reasons for. Williams&apos; character is out of step with the rest of the faculty at the school and encourages his students to seize the day. Anyone who grew up with the overbearing-we-expect-more-out-of-you parents, or even attended boarding school, or grew up in some similar environment can identify with the students in the film.\n\nEvery aspect of this film is powerful. From screenplay to direction, casting to acting, the movie drags us into a world of teenagers that are REAL. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes rebellious ... sometimes they win, sometimes they lose. This is very much a Peter Weir film. The screenplay is one the most powerful ones ever, and one characteristic of this movie is the evolution the characters go through. Just like Truman Show, Witness, The Last Wave and Fearless, Weir drags his characters into the story and changes them. He evolves them so that, in the end, his characters are more human and feel something beyond traditional beliefs and codes; Things that people have died for throughout history: Freedom, Respect, Pride... things that may not be that important to an average person, things that make one a hero.",

Still worth watching but you will end up cursing the writers, producers and perhaps even the actors for that low quality ending. Even if the story was written to end this way, it could have been communicated far better and with far more realistic excitement. It seems like they just plonked it at the end rather than continue the story. What the hell happened? Did they run out of time or needed to release it by a specific date or did the original scriptwriter run off? The end the film was not of the same quality of the rest of the film and left me feeling shortchanged.",

            "reviewBody": "In watching this fine film, on idea kept running though my mind. That being terrorism often hurts the innocent much more than the declared enemy. In the Name of the Father is a powerful, well-acted drama about terrorism and injustice. And also the love one man feels for his father. Some of the events in this film are factual, and others are not. Despite some liberties taken with history, the film still makes a strong point, however.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis plays Gerry Conlon, a young man falsely accused along with several other friends and family members, of bombing a London pub in 1974. The bombing, performed by the IRA, killed a few persons and wounded several others. Conlon and his friends just happen to be near by when the bombing takes place. Through police torture, Conlon and his best friend confess to the crime, thinking a trial will exonerate them. Trouble is, there had been so many recent bombings that the legal system in Britain was just crying out for a scapegoat. Conlon and four friends are given life sentences. Several members of Conlon&apos;s family are also given stiff jail sentences. Even his own father who seems to be the most righteous and kind person imaginable and who never set foot in England at all during the time of the bombing!\n\nThe film starts out like a shot from a cannon, as we see just how violent and chaotic Blefast was during the early seventies. Just living a normal life looked impossible. If the British troops weren&apos;t after you, then the IRA members were. The film also scores when we see Conlon head off to London to presumably make a better life for himself. He and a friend force themselves into a commune and enjoy a brief period of free love and decadence. The film gets very heavy once Conlon is arrested and tortured. And the last hour detailing his time behind bars is just plain somber. We watch his father just sort of waste away with him behind bars while an aggressive lawyer (Emma Thompson) fights to get them out. Pete Postletwaite is exceptional as Gerry&apos;s father, and seeing him grow sicker and weak is very difficult for the viewer. \n\nThe film tries to shift gears down the stretch and show how Conlon has become determined and more radicalized, but these scenes are nothing spectacular. Even the conclusion seems a little anti-climatic, but at least we see some justice finally get done. The acting is very, very good. Lewis is as good as ever, and nobody looks out of their league. There are some historical liberties taken. Gerry and his father never actually lived in the same cell, for instance. Overall, this film will stick with you, though.\n\nIn watching this film, one cannot help but feel for the victims of terrorism. I have personally not much knowledge of the conflict between the IRA and Britain, except to say that I&apos;m well aware of how long and deep the scars run between the English and Irish peoples. That said, there is simply no excuse for terrorism. Look at how many victims that pub bombing created. Not only those who perished or were injured. That act of terror sent several innocent people to jail and ruined their lives! The British legal system is certainly to blame for sending the wrong people to jail, but would this have even happened if the IRA had not bombed that pub? A similar situation can be seen in the Middle East today. Radical Muslims look to strike out at Western interests, but their actions often hurt scores more other Muslims than any actual Western interests! Will we ever all learn to get along on this planet?\n\n8 of 10 stars.\n\nThe Hound.",

It has some great fun character, some awesome moments and some well placed comical moments. &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; is entertainment at its bests.\n\nThe voice cast is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Crystal form a great leading duo. Steve Buscemi is a great villain and James Coburn has a great voice that fits his character perfectly. John Ratzenberger as always is very entertaining this time in a role as banished Yeti.\n\nThe story itself is pretty simple but thats what makes it easy to follow and so much fun to watch. The movie not only knows how to entertaining but also knows how and when to emote. The combination of fun and emotional things is perfectly balanced and placed within the movie.\n\nThere is some great dialog but the true power of &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; are the wonderful characters. Not is there only a wild variety of strange and weird characters but also some characters that are good for some serious laughs and Boo is simply adorable and a pretty fair representation of a kid in real life. Well done Pixar!\n\nPure entertainment for the entire family!\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "reviewBody": "I caught a sneak peak yesterday, and must say, this film is a classic. It is not as flashy as cars, or as action packed as Incredibles, but it is a masterpiece of restraint and heart, that matches the classics from the golden age of the film industry. Pixar has always been groundbreaking for smart and fun animated features, but Ratatouille might just be what puts them over the top as one of the BEST all around film-making teams in history.\n\nRatatouille is a treat for film lovers. It feels like a classic. The animationis absolutely beautiful, especially the scenery of Paris which evoked awes from the audience, as if we were seeing a grandiose fireworks show.\n\nThe story is oh so classy and universal, especially when you look at it as a parable to yourself and society. Sometimes the story seems familiar, yet it is packed with so much genuine heart and individuality, that it might even be too &quot;indie&quot; for most audiences. But those who are patient and willing to open their minds and hearts, even when it may challenge the viewers to rethink their own personal biases, will find within this entertaining, sweet, simple film a remarkable message about challenging societal norms and not letting anything stand in your way of your dreams. When you follow your dreams, you never know what an impact it will have upon you, or those you might encounter on the journey. Just see the film, and be open to its message, and I am sure if you allow it too, it will touch you as well.\n\nP.S. : The short in front of the feature is the funniest animated short film pixar has ever done, so even if ratatouille might not be as flashy as many might want it to be, the short film will have everyone in stitches, as it did our entire theater. So just go and see it, and be prepared for a wonderful two hours.",

In my opinion, these comments miss the point of the movie.\n\nOf course many of the scenes in the first hour don&apos;t advance the narrative. They&apos;re not supposed to; they&apos;re for character development.\n\nThe whole point of the movie is to show us how the various characters were affected by the war. It wouldn&apos;t have worked nearly as powerfully as it does had the first hour been trimmed down. We have to sense the careless and frat-boy-like immaturity of these young men. That&apos;s why the scenes all revolve around frivolity and seemingly senseless boyish behavior; it creates such a stark contrast to the devastated characters of the three who went to war (and the relatively unaffected personalities of those who stayed behind, like Stanley).\n\nThe strong points of the film are the outstanding performances of nearly every actor in the movie. Yes, there are technical deficiencies in the sound, but it hardly matters. This is nitpicking compared to the overall construction of the film.",

I have NOT seen anything written like this in Tamil cinema before.\n\nAny details about the plot may potentially reveal spoilers so I&apos;ll refrain from doing so. Vijay Sethupathi and Anurag Kashyap were GREAT (minus the lip-sync) along with the secondary characters. Any actor could have played these roles, from the Nassers to the SJ Suryas; but the screen presence that these two have elevates the scenes and the brand of the movie that will make people buy the tickets; and rightfully so - because a film like this deserves to be seen by many.\n\nBut to put the actors ABOVE the script and the screenplay would be blasphemous. VJS will likely get over-credited for this movie and that&apos;s fine as long the writing gets the most props for this film. It would be an injustice otherwise.\n\nIs everything a 100% perfect? No. But the brilliance that the writing has demonstrated overshadows that things that didn&apos;t work for me along with a couple of the casting choices didn&apos;t have any impact on the plot. Could have been anybody, and folks who were chosen didn&apos;t add to the screen presence either. However this is not the movie to nitpick on.\n\nGo in blank, sit back and watch things unfold. You have not seen anything like this before. If you&apos;re a cinema lover, you&apos;re in for a special treat with the screenplay.",

The story is simple, yet interesting and fun, and the movie comes in at much less than one hour, 44 minutes to be exact. While there are a few points in the movie that are disjointed and not as fun, overall you can stay engrossed enough until you get to some really cool and innovative special effects, which given the technological limitations when this was filmed in the 1920&apos;s are simply amazing.",

            "reviewBody": "Buster Keaton&apos;s &quot;The General,&quot; about a man and his engine, puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen. From major comic situations to throwaway gags, &quot;The General&quot; always knows what to do.\n\nThe story begins in leisurely fashion. A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray (Keaton) has two loves in his life: his engine and his girlrespectively, The General and Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle, followed by two engineer-worshipping boys and, unknown to him, Annabelle Lee herself. He and his entourage arrive at the door; Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs, slicks back his hair, and gently taps the door with the door knocker. Then he turns to notice Annabelle. Keaton&apos;s understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness. Any other comedian would have done an explosive double-take.\n\nNow Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor, but the boys are there, too. Johnnie stands up, puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave. The hero-worshippers are ready to follow, but Johnnie lets them out first, then closes the door on them. This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy. At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pants.\n\nNow the two are alone. Annabelle&apos;s father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon: the War Between the States has begun. Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist, then turns expectantly to Johnnie, who cocks his head like a confused puppy. She asks, &quot;Aren&apos;t you going to enlist?&quot; Realization hits him, and he leaps off the seat. Before he can run out the door, Annabelle kisses him. This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porch.\n\nJohnnie races to the general store, which is now a makeshift recruitment office. Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line. The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching inonly he and the rest of the line go in two different directions, and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again. He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation, but the man rejects him. Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer. Later, Annabelle believes that Johnnie didn&apos;t even try to enlist. She refuses to speak to him again until he&apos;s in uniform. What follows is a classic moment: Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine. He&apos;s so miserable that he doesn&apos;t notice when he starts moving up and down, until just before the train enters a tunnel.\n\nTime passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General. When (nearly) everyone is off the train having dinner, the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine. Annabelle, a passenger herself, was still on board. She is now their prisoner.\n\nBut Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen, possibly by deserters. He pursues the engine by taking another, The Texas. Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas, but the Unionists think they&apos;re outnumbered and continue to run. What follows is the true joy of the movie: two long chases (separated by an important plot twist). Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop action.\n\nI love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas. At one point, the car, which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track, reappears in front of the baffled engineer, only to disappear later just as mysteriously. We see the logical circumstances that lead to the car&apos;s seeming magic act, and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied, preventing him from seeing what we see.\n\nComic logic is important to &quot;The General.&quot; In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable. In a throwaway gag, Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack. Of courseof course!he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for it.\n\nWe move to the second chase, where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him. Now Johnnie must contend with Annabelle Lee.\n\nMarion Mack leaves no mark of her personality on the screen. She deserves credit mainly for being willing and able to take it. Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn were never thrown around, trod upon or knocked about the way Marion Mack was. She has hilarious moments. The excitement of the chase does not prevent her from taking out a broom to sweep the dusty floor of the engine. An exasperated Johnnie tells her to keep throwing wood into the fire. She takes a small stick and daintily puts it in. Johnnie sarcastically hands her a sliver, and she puts that in, too. Then, in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping, Johnnie grabs her and half-throttles her before kissing her instead.\n\nThe final section, most of it a battle scene, includes the shot where The Texas begins to cross a burning bridge, only to crash into the river. Owing to Keaton&apos;s disdain of fakery (one of several reasons his works seem modern) he did not use a model but a real train on a real burning bridge. The crash cost $42,000reportedly making it the single most expensive shot ever in a silent film.\n\nA worthy closing gag was too taxing even for Keaton&apos;s ingenuity. Johnnie&apos;s dilemma is to kiss his girl while saluting the passing soldiers. His remedy is only mildly funny. Is anyone complaining? &quot;The General&quot; is a work of art and a work of genius."

            "reviewBody": "Coming from Australia, Mary and Max is one of these few films you&apos;ll remember all your life. This amazing claymation touches upon an unlikely friendship between two pen pals: a young girl living in Australia and an aging Jew from New York. It&apos;s unbelievable what a precisely structured narrative this is. Director-writer Adam Elliot blends odd scatological, yet clever humour with poignant dramatizations to a splendid effect creating one of the best tragicomedies of the past few years. The fact that it&apos;s in the form of claymation only helps to enhance uniqueness of the whole experience. The movie was 5 years in the making and this is visible in its every frame. Elliot masterly captures the motion in an endlessly creative manner. Most importantly though, his lovably oddball characters are well developed and admirably complex with all their awkward traits and quirks. Due to its serious themes and dark tone, Mary and Max is an adult movie aiming much higher than its big studio counterparts. It happens to be more contemplative, and intelligent mimicking the real life with all its ups and downs. Calling Elliot&apos;s movie an extraordinary piece of art is certainly not an overstatement.",

He definitely appears haunted in this movie, he has a look in his eyes.\n\n9/10.",

In a steamy, impoverished Latin American town called Las Piedras, insects grope clumsily in the dust, struggling to escape the strings that children have tied to them. People from all over the world congregate in the streets and bars and the air is thick with choking dust. Clouzot makes clear the desperation of the residents, &quot;It&apos;s like prison,&quot; explains one of them. &quot;Easy to get in, but escape is impossible.&quot; The Southern Oil Company (SOC - same initials as Standard Oil) runs the town and enjoys its profits while the villagers are compelled to work odd jobs just to stay alive. After a fire breaks out at one of the oil fields killing many workers, the anti-union American boss seeks experienced drivers from among the townspeople to put out the fire. It is here that the anti-American flavor runs thick and where much of this part of the film was originally excised for American audiences (but has since been restored). \n\nFour men, desperate to escape their trap, agree to drive a truck loaded with nitroglycerine 300 miles over treacherous mountain roads in the hot sun for the sum of $2000 each. Transporting the nitroglycerine for them is a way out of hopelessness -- either through a big paycheck or through sudden death, with the latter appearing the more probable. Though sadly past the point in time when we can still be shocked over gangster capitalism and men selling out for money, the story is nonetheless compelling. The four who are chosen to go on this fool&apos;s errand include Mario, a young Corsican played by Yves Montand in a role that brought him widespread attention. He is carrying on an affair with a local servant girl, Linda (Vera Clouzot) who is in love with him. His treatment of her, however, is atrocious and reflects the attitude of the male-dominated society they live in. Also picked to drive one of the trucks is Jo, an aging Parisian small-time crook (Charles Vanel), Luigi (Folco Lulli), an Italian with less than a year to live, and an ex-nazi pilot (Peter van Eyck). This unlikely group will play a cat-and-mouse game with death for the remainder of the film.\n\nClouzot depicts several incidents that bring the tension to the boiling point. In the first one, the trucks must travel at least 40 mph over a pot-holed stretch of road to prevent the vibrations from setting off the nitroglycerine. The second involves a sharp, narrow turn that requires the trucks to back up onto an unstable, rotten wooden platform causing it to buckle. Almost immediately afterwards, the trucks are stopped by a huge boulder in the middle of the road and must siphon off some of the nitroglycerine to blow it up. Finally, Mario must deftly maneuver the truck over a depression of spilled oil with the wheels stuck in reverse. As the long treacherous journey unfolds, roles are reversed between Mario and Jo as Mario becomes the strong dominant one and Jo, in Charles Vanel&apos;s brilliant performance, becomes shaken, fearful, and docile. Their relationship becomes the highlight of the film as the two become mutually dependent on each other for survival and comfort. \n\nI found Wages of Fear to be an involving experience that kept me riveted throughout, though I did sense that there would not be a two and a half-hour film unless somebody survived. Although the unexpected plot twists were gripping, the best part of the film for me was the revelation of each character when faced with fear. It reminded me of the &quot;Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, a film that also showed men discovering the truth about themselves and others while pursuing their dream of wealth. Wages of Fear lived up to its accolades, but for me the discordant ending clashed both with the tone of the film and with my experience of the universe not as arbitrary or capricious but as filled with meaning and purpose."

            "reviewBody": "Now, I must admit that this is one of my top five favorite films. There is a warmth, idealism, and kinda simple feeling of hope, that makes one believe that things will work out in the end. Capra knew exactly what he wanted, and it shines. Jimmy Stewart, in the role of his life, makes us believe, what we know is almost impossible in todays crass world.\n\nClaude Rains is incredible as Senator Smith&apos;s evil mentor. Jean Arthur, as his confidant, plays the part so well,that we just want her to save the day.\n\nThe final scene, where the filibuster is taking place, is among the greatest ever made.\n\nBUT THE PROOF, YOU ASK?\n\nIn the early 80s, I showed this film, over three days, to a group of 15 year old inner city teenagers. I taught Political Science in a very difficult school in Chicago. It was a new class, and not all of the &quot;best&quot; students took it.\n\nI decided to show this film at the end of the year, just to see how long I could keep the students attention. I didn&apos;t expect much. Fifteen is a very tough age to keep any kind of attention span, and it was at the end of the day, 2:30 -3:15 pm. which made things worse. As the film began, there was rustling in the seats, boredom, that famous oh what a waste of time look...Mind you, this is 43 year old film, about a white Senator, in those &quot;old&quot; days, and being shown to a totally Afro-American crowd of 15 year olds, late in the day, (over a three day period, which meant the students would have to wait till the next day to see what was going on. ..By the end of the third day, Capra had worked his magic, and the entire class was spellbound by this film. They were there till the very end, and you could see how much they enjoyed seeing a film, that they wouldn&apos;t have looked at in a thousand years..Comments were wonderful. Any film that could accomplish this, more than 40 years after its conception, to a crowd that no one would believe would have any interest in, deserves to be truly called a &quot;great film.&quot;",

I guess it&apos;s because I&apos;m a movie lover and want to enter my little note of appreciation. What sticks in my mind from the movie&apos;s first release are the visuals. They&apos;re among the most memorable if not the most memorable in film annals. In sum, they&apos;re a nightmare world of emptiness-the streets, the walkways, the dead hulking edifices. It&apos;s a communal world emptied of community, leaving only ruins and shells. The metaphor for a post-war Europe is unmistakable, while only the morally destitute like Harry Lime have thrived. I can&apos;t imagine that filming in color was actually entertained (IMDB). Had that happened, the film would have passed into semi-obscurity unlike its now celebrated status. Note too, that no one ends up happy, in contrast to narrative norms of the day. I think what brought many folks to showings at the time was the unfamiliar zither music. As I recall, a commercial cut was heard regularly on the radio. Still, I expect a lot of folks left the theater put-off by the bleakly unhappy world they had just seen. Anyway, the movie remains a brilliant slice of cinematic imagination and should not be missed."

This film, even with the occasional technical issues and bad punches, is a wonderous underdog story that brings me joy every time I watch it. I wish this original story would have been made in this era with more attention on the little details as to keep those little pesky nuances from detracting from the story itself. This film is still very much a classic, especially with the need of an uplifting story during that time.\n\nI believe the writer, Stallone, and director, John G. Avildsen, did an immaculate job intertwining both the sport story and the love story between Rocky and Adrian, played by Talia Shire. The editing had moments where it felt a little like it was dragging on, even though it was purposeful, but the ability to effectively display the slow love in contrast to the fast-paced boxing was spot on. This film has a decent number of things that can be criticized which I believe has a lot to do with when it was produced, but overall this film, particularly the story, is a stand alone classic to my whole family.",

The younger generation (and by extension the &quot;new&quot; Japan) turns its back on the family from which it arose- because of selfishness, because of necessity, or because it&apos;s simply the way of the world. The movie provides no easy answers- its melancholy ambiguity is part of its charm. Whatever the case, Ozu delights in portraying the details of everyday life. The emotional resonances of this movie are extraordinary, and some shots (a child picking flowers, an old couple framed by the sea, a woman sitting forlornly at her work desk) are enough to give a sensitive film-goer the shivers. Despite the testimony of some critics, the film is not totally devoid of melodramatic elements (some stock characters and cloying musical motifs spring readily to mind), but the film is founded upon such an obvious love and respect for the importance of real-world interactions that it&apos;s hard not to be anything other than enthralled by it.",

            "reviewBody": "The Coen brothers are up there with my very favorite filmmakers (Scorsese, Kubrick, Carpenter).  I am very fond of their work.  Throughout their irreverent career, they have explored different subjects and themes.  Their best stories evolve from  kidnapping schemes in films like &quot;Raising Arizona &quot; and &quot;Fargo&quot;, one of my very favorites.  I thought that film was fervently free.  I was so ever wrong. It&apos;s as if the Coen Brothers have celebrated their complete breakthrough success (Academy Award winners), and now are willing to do whatever they please.  &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is a film so meandering, so wonderfully novel, that I found myself missing the many other sporadic jokes as I was heaving from laughter.  The film is basically about mistaken identity, eccentric characters, and a soiled rug.  This film extols the bowler, the allies, even the pins.  We experience an actual bowling ball POV, as the Dude (Jeff Bridges) hallucinates.  This film has nihilists, feminists, millionares, paedophiles, drugged out hippies, underachieving students, incompetent criminals, pornographers and &apos;Nam veterans.  This movie is open to anything , anything... Some people are turned off by absurd looniness, because it&apos;s so grandiosely different.  Yet who couldn&apos;t chuckle, if not explode, when a bowler dressed in a tight purple suit licks a bowling ball&apos;s finger hole, and the camera pans down to reveal his name as Jesus! I will disclose no more, but urgently recommend you to traverse to your nearest video abode and rent this true escapists&apos; feature. Abandon all solemn inhibitons, though!  One can not keep a straight face whilst watching.",

            "reviewBody": "The mysteries of religion and death have long been a popular focus among artists of all media, including film.  And while many films question these mysteries, they seldom provide any real insight into the world of the unknown.  In Ingmar Bergman&apos;s THE SEVENTH SEAL, these mysteries are not only questioned; they are dissected, splayed, and scrutinized.\n\nTHE SEVENTH SEAL could very well serve as sort of a manifesto for existentialism.  Its deep acuity and haunting imagery is powerful enough to jar even passive viewers out of their complacency and force them to examine their own reality.  The delicately crafted story centers around a 14th century knight named Antonius Block and his ongoing game of chess with a shadowy, hooded figure: Death.  Bergman uses this allegory not just to personify death, but to illustrate the lengths man will go to in order to avoid it.  In the end, however, Death is a much better player than any of us, and though he may humor some of his opponents by letting them think that they have the advantage, the end result is inevitable: Death always wins. No matter how skillfully we plan our moves or how determined we are to win, we can never beat Death.\n\nIn Antonius&apos;s search for answers, he encounters a variety of very unique characters, each with their own outlook on life, death, faith, fear and love.  Their commentary on such matters is often dryly funny and always brilliant, continuously and effectively challenging our perceptions of the world around us.  For me, the dialogue was definitely the high point of the film, as it was extremely thought-provoking and carefully constructed throughout.  Almost every line spoken is, in one way or another, daunting and unforgettable.  Jöns&apos;s description of love as &quot;the blackest of all plagues&quot; is a quote that will forever be engraved in my mind.\n\nTHE SEVENTH SEAL truly is a remarkable accomplishment in the world of cinema.  It is a deep, mesmerizing, and darkly beautiful work of art.  More importantly, THE SEVENTH SEAL is one of those rare movies that doesn&apos;t just entertain, but also has the power to change the way one thinks."

            "reviewBody": "Before you consider watching &quot;Spotlight&quot;, I STRONGLY urge you to think twice. It isn&apos;t because I think it&apos;s a bad film--it&apos;s amazingly good. But it&apos;s also a difficult film to watch--particularly if you or someone close to you has been a victim of sexual abuse. I know that in my case, it was particularly tough because I am a retired psychotherapist and used to specialize in working with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators...the latter, which, I think benefit very little from treatment (which is much of the reasons I changed careers).\n\nThe story is about not only the discovery of a huge number of pedophile priests in the Boston parish by Boston Globe reporters but the organization&apos;s discovery that the problem went all the way to the top. In other words, even the beloved Cardinal Bernard Law KNEW about the many, many victims and yet did nothing to discipline them or restrict their access to more victims. But the film doesn&apos;t just talk about so much that we know to be true today but it covers the stop by step process by which the paper began and completed the investigation.\n\nWhy did I give the film a 10...particularly since I almost never give films such high scores? Well, the reason is that the folks making the movie really, really cared about the subject matter and getting it right. Instead of focusing on making money with the film and including the usual glitz and glamour, the filmmakers chose instead to emphasize realism above all else. Normal looking actors (such as Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo) are used...and they make efforts to keep them normal looking. Additionally, the film has a relatively slow and deliberate pace--again as they weren&apos;t interested in making a pretty or Hollywoodizing the production. Overall, a great film made greater because the folks making it really, really seemed to care and wanted to get it right...which showed great sensitivity for the subject matter and the victims. Great film!",

I&apos;m just at a loss for words and struggling to describe how truly powerful and heart-grabbing this story was. I&apos;ll go so far as to say that if you don&apos;t cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (or while) watching Room, you don&apos;t have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson) and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The beauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally relatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep, deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears; sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It made me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had my eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was witnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and one of the best uses of cinema I&apos;ve ever seen. ...Try not to read much/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitely catch it in a theater near you ASAP). Go in and be engrossed and moved (in ways I can&apos;t describe) by this experience. 10/10 *Hands down* the best film of 2015, and the single best thing I&apos;ve seen in years. :&apos;)",

Films like Avatar, Titanic and True Lies had huge budgets and drew in even bigger box office but many still yearn for the Cameron that gave us The Terminator and Aliens which were huge movies but packed a far bigger punch artistically. My feelings all these years on are that Cameron has earned the right to make those huge movies but i have to admit to preferring his earlier body of work. The Terminator is a nightmarish, time travelling science fiction film told at a breakneck pace and delivered with confidence and style. The film has a very gritty, underground look to it and does a great job of telling its story amid the frenetic action. There is also a huge slice of horror and suspense thrown in, an impression that has diminished in the years since it&apos;s release due to inferior sequels. Viewed as a standalone piece however, The Terminator is fine piece of work from a director with a very clear vision.Everyone knows that The Terminator is the film that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger but when i look back at the film, it has heart and its the Michael Biehn character, Kyle Reese, that provides it Artistically speaking,Cameron might be well advised that less is more.",

After assassination President of Rwanda, all get worse. It begins the horrible genocide including rampage , massacres and ravage in Rwanda which is spread along Burundi. Slaughter of Tusis by the Hutu is executed by soldiers and rebels. A journalist (Joaquin Phoenix) get into tumult and will shoot the events to show it all around the world. Paul gets to protect his family and unfortunate refugees at the hotel but others hapless people by the hundred are coming to ask for help. Meanwhile, the refugees Tutsis flee toward Congo to find shelter .The film has an acid critic to the indolence of United Nations (exception for Colonel incarnated by Nick Nolte) and international community and specially , the abandon of the European foreign policy .\n\nAn interesting and thought-provoking film depicting terrible happenings and based on historical facts . Thus, a character tells that origin conflict is due to Belgians whom in colonization time differentiated the Tutsi as highest and more white complexion and co-governed united the country, now the Hutu are taking the vengeance. It&apos;s calculated in the indiscriminate massacre were cruelly killed by militia Interhamwe approximately one million people and in only three month. The bloody conflict finished in 1994 when the Tutsi throw out the Hutu army and militia through the frontier Congo. Leader of Interhamwe was condemned to maxim penalty. Don Cheadle&apos;s interpretation is magnificent , he was nominated to Academy Award , although wrongly didn&apos;t obtain it . The motion picture well directed by Terry George. Rating : Awesome and above average . Indispensable and essential watching.",

            "reviewBody": "Ever since Steven Spielberg wowed the cinematic world and changed the aesthetic of the war movie forever with the exceptional opening 25 minutes of 1998&apos;s Saving Private Ryan - the film went downhill from there - audiences have come to expect the same grainy camera-work and ultra-realism of Spielberg&apos;s breathtaking vision whenever a battle is depicted. Anything else would be &apos;unrealistic&apos;, and many movies dated horribly almost overnight as a result. While Oliver Stone&apos;s Platoon, which was once considered difficult to watch due to its unflinching depiction of the insanity of war, may not seem quite as brutal as it used to, it possesses one thing that no war other movie can boast - the guiding hand of a veteran.\n\nStone did a tour in Vietnam which ended in 1968, changing the future writer/director forever. Starting out life as a screenplay focusing on a soldier&apos;s experiences both before and during the war which had Jim Morrison touted for the lead, it evolved into a movie focused solely on a young volunteer&apos;s time spent in the sweaty, eternally damp jungle. Charlie Sheen&apos;s Chris Taylor is an obvious stand-in for Stone, and he arrives fresh-faced and eager to fight for his country. By the end, he is dazed and confused, and angry at the country who would send such &quot;bottom of the barrel&quot; men - invisible in society - into a world of such horror and meaningless bloodshed. It&apos;s an experience that moulded Stone into the one of the most outspoken voices in cinema.\n\nThe casting of the two sergeants vying for Chris&apos; soul is a stroke of genius. The platoon is made up of two main groups - the &apos;juicers&apos;, a collection of beer-swilling meat-heads seemingly intent on violence at every opportunity, and the &apos;heads&apos;, a more laid-back and weary bunch who are happiest when getting high and having a singalong. At the head of the juicers is Sgt. Barnes, played by Tom Berenger, an actor known for his heart-throb leading-man roles but here cast as a dead-eyed, heavily scarred brute. While Willem Dafoe, who was and still is known for his crazy-eyed villainous roles, plays the wiser, gentler leader of the heads, an all-round good guy battling his own demons. By toying with expectations, Stone adds layers to their characters, and they both received Best Actor nominations for their efforts.\n\nYet what makes Platoon truly stand out 30 years after its release is the way Stone manages to transport the audience to that terrible place. It&apos;s teeming with dangers at every turn, be it the ants, the snakes or the Viet Cong better equipped for the harsh surroundings, the most frightening moment is when they fall asleep. And even when they awake, there&apos;s something moving in the shadows. The film never allows you to ever be at ease, despite the fun to be had with spotting the many famous faces dotted throughout the supporting cast. There are flaws, especially with some overacting from some of the supporting cast - in particular John C. McGinley - and Chris&apos; unnecessary, rambling narration, but the movie packs such a punch that it&apos;s easy to forget these quibbles. It&apos;s a true insight into the mind of a grunt and how combat can have a lasting, eye-opening effect on those on the ground, and undoubtedly one of the most important war pictures ever to come out of the US.",

If it wasn&apos;t for this movie, Johnny Depp wouldn&apos;t be as famous as he is today. Every scene with him or Geoffery Rush is brilliant. The movie is very crisp and the shots of the islands are breathtaking. Definitely a movie worth picking up at Blockbuster or even better, buying ( I don&apos;t buy DVDs often but this was one of them). The characters are thought out very well and plot is excellent. The script is one of the main stars of the film itself, every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa&apos;s mouth or any of the other cast is original. If you like action films you&apos;ll love this, if you like comedy you&apos;ll love this, actually, this movie is great for everyone (except small kids, who may get frightened by the skeleton scenes). 10/10"

Soon Vinz shows the missing gun that he found in the night before and he tells that if Abdel dies, he will revenge his friend killing a police officer. The trio of troublemaker and pothead friends head to the downtown of Paris where they spend the day asking for trouble. On the end of the long night, tragedy happens.\n\nThe awarded &quot;La Haine&quot; is an impressive French movie that follows along 24 hours, the lives of three idle friends from a poor suburb of Paris that belong to a lost generation. I saw this movie in the 90&apos;s and today I have decided to see it again to compare the situations shown in the movie with what is recently happening in Brazil with several riots and it is amazing the similarities: lost youths with neither instruction nor job; unprepared and brutal police force; low quality of life in the slums or ghettos in the outskirts of the big cities (in Brazil, there are several slums also in the noble areas). The only difference is basically that France belongs to the First World and Brazil to the Third World; the rest is identical. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Ódio&quot; (&quot;The Hate&quot;)",

They&apos;ve  changed--originally they were in their 20s and full of idealism. Now  they&apos;re in their 30s--and their lives have changed in ways they didn&apos;t  predict. Like the first movie they walk around Paris this time and talk about love, life, reality, what  might have been--and it&apos;s all fascinating. Like the first film this is  basically a character study and (like the first) just incredible. It&apos;s  like catching up with old friends after 9 years apart! They&apos;ve aged a  lot--Hawke looks TERRIBLE but Delpy looks OK--and life has thrown both  a few hard knocks but hearing how they survived and what they went  through is just incredible.   This is NOT for everybody (four people walked out when I went to see  it) but, for people who can deal with nonstop talk for 80 minutes it is  just great. Every single line rings true and is delivered full force by  Hawke and Delpy. The acting varies--Hawke is good (but he smiles WAY  too much)--Delpy is just superb all the way through.  This is easily one of the best films of 2004. Highly recommended.",

            "reviewBody": "I first saw this film (one of my top ten favorites) in 1995 on the big screen, as part of the commemorations for the 50th anniversary of the end of WWII. It had an impact that was so strong that it&apos;s never left me--I&apos;ve seen it many times since, and with each viewing the film seems to reveal new artistic richness and spiritual depth.\n\nWilliam Wyler&apos;s direction is breathtaking.  One of the most moving scenes occurs early on in the film, when Homer, the young disabled Navy veteran, arrives at his family home and stands for a moment on the front lawn.  For that one second there is an exquisite stillness that communicates a depth of emotion that can&apos;t be expressed physically.  Then, just as the tension becomes almost unbearable, Homer&apos;s little sister Louella comes to the front door and runs out to greet him.  In a similar way, the scene where Al Stephenson comes home to his wife and children is so finely directed you can almost feel that you&apos;re in the apartment with them--that it&apos;s your husband or father come home to you from the war--and you&apos;re experiencing the sheer elation of their physical nearness.\n\nThis aspect of the film--its portrayal of the joys and hardships of post-war readjustment and the veterans&apos; experience--is what makes it so enlightening, honest and powerful.  As a young woman, I have never experienced wartime or had my father, brothers or friends go off to fight. The film moves swiftly but seamlessly from the initial joy of homecoming and reunion to the problems, anxieties and humiliations that the three veterans encounter as they attempt to build a new life for themselves and their families.\n\n I found it interesting how the film tries to give a picture of the different socio-economic backgrounds of the three men, and show the emergence of an affluent, market-driven economy.  While this in itself is not bad, different episodes in the film show how this economic approach can conflict sharply at times with enduring human values such as integrity and justice.  Al&apos;s dealings with the young veteran Mr Novak, who comes to him for a service loan to buy a farm, and his later (slightly tipsy) speech to a business gathering show this.  Al declares at the end of his speech that when the bank lends money to poor veterans it will be a financial gamble but &quot;we&apos;ll be gambling on the future of this country&quot;.\n\nThe film&apos;s interweaving of the characters and their struggles never falters and is deeply satisfying.  Even as Al and Milly, Homer and Wilma gradually move towards a happy resolution of their difficulties this positive strand of the film is counter-balanced by the focus on Fred, the courageous Air Force captain who, in the eyes of the commercial world is &quot;unqualified&quot;, suitable only for a job at a soda fountain, and in the eyes of his war bride, Marie, is only wonderful when he&apos;s dressed up in his officer&apos;s uniform.  Fred&apos;s situation seems only to deteriorate and at one point in the film, after he farewells his elderly father to leave town and look for work, the father finds the citations for Fred&apos;s medals and sits down to read them. As he reads the words describing Fred&apos;s bravery and dedication to duty while he was terribly wounded in his aircraft, Pat Derry&apos;s voice nearly breaks with pride and love for his son.  The film beautifully juxtaposes Fred&apos;s unselfish conduct and willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice with the cold indifference of a country in peacetime that does not want him and seemingly has no place for him.\n\nThe actors are uniformly impressive and really make their characters come alive.  Dana Andrews is especially outstanding together with two young actors making their debut, Harold Russell and Cathy O&apos;Donnell, as Homer and Wilma.  Personally, I loved Homer and Wilma&apos;s story the best among those of all the characters,and the resolution is a simple, sensitively shot scene that lifts the whole film to a new point of happiness, gratitude and release.  Both Cathy O&apos;Donnell and Teresa Wright are lovely, gifted actresses with a slightly understated style, that is perfectly suited to the film&apos;s restrained but powerful tenor.  This is demonstrated especially well in the tense scene where Wilma tries to talk to Homer in the shed, and in the scene where Peggy confides her heartache to her parents.\n\nOne feature that adds significantly to the film&apos;s quality is Hugo Friedhofer&apos;s score.  The music is remarkably fresh and undated, has a strong, classic sound, and is poignant without being too romantic or sentimental (a flaw often found in other 1940s film scores).\n\nThe producer, Samuel Goldwyn, reportedly said of this film: &quot;I don&apos;t care if it doesn&apos;t make a nickel...I just want every man, woman and child in America to see it&quot;.  Although I&apos;m not American (I am Australian) I found this film, with its universal human themes and its portrayal of post-war readjustment, speaks to anyone who shares in this heritage of WWII.  Tell others about this film--it is breathtaking, beautiful and brave.  See it and remember."

            "reviewBody": "What can one say about this work of art that has not been said many times before by those far better qualified to explain both it&apos;s importance and place as cinema and art? I shall not comment on the greatness of the film&apos;s technical achievements; the stunning cinematography, the production design, the brilliance of the screenplay based on actual transcripts from the trial, or the perfection of Mr. Dreyer&apos;s direction. The performance of Falconetti as Jeanne d&apos; Arc has a profundity and depth far beyond my ability to illuminate. I suppose the best I can hope to do is to share my feelings, however inadequately expressed, of the effect it had on me. To say that it may be the greatest film ever made is to sound both obvious and trite. That a work of such beauty and simplicity, made seventy-six years ago can still have the power to move audiences in an era of multi-million dollar, hi-tech, bombastic over-wrought cinematic drivel is in itself a testament to the vision and genius of Carl Theodor Dreyer, Maria Falconetti and their collaborators. It is nourishment for those that hunger for something more in cinema, a feast for the soul. It is a reminder that film can indeed be art, and this film like all great works of art, lifts and transports us from the routine of our work-a-day lives to enable us, if only for a moment to experience the sublime. When viewing it we look at it as looking in a mirror. That is to say we look into ourselves. We question ourselves as to our own beliefs, or the lack thereof and the strength of spirit that enables an individual to endure the unendurable. Viewing it is a profound experience the nature of which for myself is transcendent rather than religious, because I am not in the least a religious person. Transcendent because it evokes emotions and thoughts that I cannot wholly account for, or adequately explain.\n\n&quot;La Passion of Jeanne d&apos;Arc&quot; is stark, radiant, exalted, simple, (but never simplistic), and ultimately sublime. The rest is silence.",

Meanwhile , a Police Inspector (Lee J. Cobb) is investigating the weird events . And the priests suffering incredible risks trying to unravel mystery of demon living inside Regan .\n\nThis is a fairly suspenseful and horrifying story, based on a supposedly true flick . The movie begins well and grows more and more until the scary and eerie finale . Top-notch picture, thanks to fine acting , tight pacing , well mounted edition and skillful special effects with magnificent make-up by Dick Smith . Creepy acting by Linda Blair , due to death threats against Linda Blair from religious zealots who believed the film &quot;glorified Satan&quot;, Warner Bros had bodyguards protecting her for six months after the film&apos;s release . On the first day of filming the exorcism sequence, Linda Blair&apos;s delivery of her foul-mouthed dialogue so disturbed the gentlemanly Max Von Sydow that he actually forgot his lines . The script is awesome , the acting excellent and the direction by William Friedkin plenty of good pace and conviction . Enjoyable secondary cast such as Lee J Cobb , Kitty Winn and Jack McGowran who died at the time finished the movie and added a legend about Exorcist&apos;s curse . Dark cinematography in sinister and mysterious atmosphere by Owen Roitzman and frightening musical score adding Mike Oldfield&apos;s soundtrack ¨Tubular bells¨ . The tale is rated ¨R¨ for graphic violence and profanity but contains gore and guts . Reiussed in 2000 by means of a special edition by director with ten minutes approximately additional footage with new amazing scenes as Regan downing stairs .\n\nFollowed by two sequels and numerous imitations , in 1977 ¨the Heretic¨ by John Borman with Richard Burton , deemed awful and in 1990 titled ¨The Exorcist III¨ by William Peter Blatty with George C Scott, Brad Dourif , Ed Flanders and Nicol Williamson . Furthermore, spawned two prequels starred by a young Father Merrin , Stellan Skarsgard , and set in Africa , both of them directed by Paul Schrader and Renny Harlin .",

            "reviewBody": "The NBC Peacock began unfolding its wings.  &quot;The following program is brought to you in living color--with portions in black &amp; white--on NBC.&quot; That exclusive intro began my exposure to color television at Grandma&apos;s in 1968.  When Dorothy stepped out into Technicolor, I&apos;ll bet my eyes just popped.\n\nThis is the Movie of All Time, folks--a status achieved during its long run as a huge annual TV event during that classic era whose programs now show up on TV Land network.  In the 1970s, Peter Marshall once read the answer on Hollywood Squares as to the program seen more times by more people than anything else ever shown on television.  It was &quot;Oz.&quot;  Likewise, no movie has the hold on popular culture that this one does.  What lion character ever since (i.e., Snagglepuss) hasn&apos;t been an impersonation of Bert Lahr going, &quot;Put &apos;em up, put &apos;em uuuuup!&quot;\n\nFew musicals offer an equal combination of lovable music and engaging story. Perhaps &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot;  Hard to think of many Hollywood musicals where the story gets as serious as it does here when the Witch informs Dorothy that, &quot;The last to go will see the first three go before her...and her mangy little dog too!&quot;  Yikes!  In contrast, even the best of other Hollywood musicals seem to serve up fluffy, forgettable story lines that are mere backdrop to the song numbers that typically put the plot on hold.\n\nI can&apos;t say that &quot;Oz&quot; doesn&apos;t have technical flaws or story element inconsistencies.  It&apos;s just that the astonishing production values all around so overwhelm the shortcomings.  The tornado sequence is a 1939 special effects tour de force--incredible.  And the Nutcracker-quality musical score offers songs tastefully interwoven with the action.  Certain numbers like &quot;Merry Old Land of Oz,&quot; I never get tired off, though I like each of the songs.\n\nOz should be viewed in the lightness of spirit that it deserves.  I mean look, we have Frank Morgan as the Emerald City gatekeeper, then seconds later as the cabbie with the Horse of a Different Color, then the Wizard&apos;s palace guard, and then the voice of fire-and-smoke Wizard of Oz who bellows, &quot;Step forward, Tin Man!&quot;  What other film could put an actor go through 4 quick-changes within 10 minutes to such an endearing result?  &quot;Oz&quot; is as magic as those sparkling ruby shoes.\n\nThe early Technicolor process utilized triple nitrate negative strips--separately recording each primary color in light.  This was done due to the lack of a suitable &quot;color film&quot; in 1939.  That would quickly change--but films from years following suffered from hues that faded with the years, even original negatives.  Because &quot;Oz&quot; was actually filmed on a black-and-white base film, the negatives never faded.  So now we have home videos/DVDs of breathtaking color quality.  Now, the tinted filters in the cameras that separated the colors onto the negative strips meant that intense illumination was required, rendering the filming experience miserably hot for the actors involved, especially Lahr.  But they all hold up amazingly well.\n\n&quot;Oz&quot; has a valuable message.  As the pop group America once said, &quot;No, Oz never did give nothin&apos; to the Tin Man....that he didn&apos;t, didn&apos;t already have.&quot;  If we have truly search, we can find within us--or create through trial, like the Lion&apos;s courage--what we think we most lack.  The Wizard (like the Lord) helps those who find help within themselves.\n\nI feel sorry for the Almira Gulches who can&apos;t treasure this film experience. They need to visit the Emerald City to get their own ticking Testimonials and find their hearts.\n\nDidn&apos;t bring your broomsticks with you?  Well, I&apos;m afraid you&apos;ll have to walk."

Most of the attention was on a competing animated film but this is the one that turned out to be a huge box-office success. Word of mouth helped his immensely. It&apos;s what made me check it out, as several friends recommended it. I wound up agreeing with them: it&apos;s excellent entertainment.\n\nThe visuals and sound are very impressive, but it&apos;s the story that carries this film: a solid combination of humor, drama, suspense, family ties and action. The action, as in many modern-day films, was overdone in the last half hour of the movie but overall....the DVD is a good investment since people 3 to 63 should enjoy this.\n\nAs an adult, it&apos;s not always easy to keep my attention for two hours with animation but the fact this movie does, tells you how good the story is presented. There are wonderful colors in here, too, and a good 5.1 surround system with a sub-woofer would probably blow the roof off!",

You will feel like you are really there watching the racing, it&apos;s really unbelievable.\n\nIt is truly touching to see each character played their perfect role for this movie, Chris Hemsworth did a great performance, he is such a talented and devoted actor. Daniel Brühl also did a great job on portraying the eccentric and unsociable legendary F1 driver Niki Lauda.\n\nA great movie is like having a great meal, a good starter, a good soup/salad, a good main course and a good dessert, well balanced.

            "reviewBody": "In 1976 when this film came out, there was no cable television, no internet, no cell phones. All that existed, apart from newspapers and radio, were three or four &quot;broadcast&quot; television channels. Since then, technology has exploded with a cornucopia of communication devices. Which renders the story in &quot;Network&quot; painfully dated. And yet ...\n\nThe story&apos;s theme is as valid now as it was thirty-three years ago. The theme is that the ratings business has corrupted television, because ad revenue, and therefore profit, is tied to the ratings. Programs and events then, and now, get aired if, and only if, they are likely to result in high ratings. It&apos;s all very seamy, very dishonorable, very shabby, and very relevant to today&apos;s world of ten thousand channels.\n\nThough most of the characters in &quot;Network&quot; end up being corrupted by television, Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is one who does not. His vision is pure. And he speaks the truth: &quot;... television is an ... amusement park ... a circus, a carnival, a traveling troupe of ... story tellers ... jugglers, sideshow freaks ... and football players ... You&apos;re never going to get any truth from us (television) ... We lie like hell ... We deal in illusions, none of it is true. But you people ... believe the illusions ... You do whatever the tube tells you ... you even think like the tube&quot;. Worse yet, people elect their leaders based on how they look and sound, and how their words are interpreted by boob tube &quot;pundits&quot;.\n\n&quot;Network&quot; is a film wherein thematic import is conveyed almost entirely through dialogue. Some of the dialogue devolves into speechifying, which may come across to viewers as preachy. Still, the film&apos;s message was highly prophetic. Except for the film&apos;s climax, everything predicted in this film has already happened. And credit should go to script writer Paddy Chayefsky for his futuristic vision.\n\nSome parts of the film seem superfluous in retrospect, like the romance between two main characters. But the film has a sense of realism, helped along by the use of technical jargon and a general absence of background music. The film&apos;s technical elements, including direction, casting, acting, editing, and cinematography, are fine.\n\nAs social commentary, &quot;Network&quot; is one of the best films ever made, despite a dated, time-bound, story. That &quot;there are no nations, only currency&quot; is becoming increasingly obvious, and as Ned Beatty&apos;s arrogant character explains in a frighteningly ominous tone: &quot;The world is a business, Mr. Beale&quot;.",

It simply has everything one could want in a movie. First of all, it has a REAL romance - one where you can watch the characters slowly fall in love. It&apos;s not like today&apos;s movies where two characters meet and the next scene is them waking up together. Secondly, it has humor. Not syrupy or corny humor, but very wry, dry tongue-in-cheek humor. For evidence, look at the quotes. Baronness Schraeder is especially well-done in this regard. Her comments simply drip with ice. &quot;Good bye, Maria. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll make a fine nun.&quot;  You want to smack her. Thirdly, it&apos;s got adventure. The Nazis are the ultimate villains in any movie - WWII was as clear a case of good vs. evil as you can find, making it great fodder for films - and so it&apos;s great to see Maria, the Captain and the kids outwit them. Fourthly, it&apos;s got great music. Fifthy, it&apos;s got great scenery. And the plot and dialogue are astounding. I find new things to admire each time I watch. Finally, is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns revealing the stolen Nazi car parts??? &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; does not just succeed because it cheers people up with syrup or song.  It succeeds because it is a wonderfully-constructed, wonderfully-written, wonderfully-acted, brilliant movie.  For me, no other movie can compare.  Not to be obsessed with it or anything. :)"

            "reviewBody": "Finally a film from the USA (albeit based on a true story in the 1920s Japan) that is without guns, explosions and free of violence and not based at all on romantic elements!\n\n&quot;Love and Loyalty&quot; succinctly sums up the film. The love so simple, so pure and the loyalty so unfailing, so steadfast that it would melt any steel heart. I was so embarrassed that as soon as the film came to the end I dashed straight into the loo only to see my eyes sore red (!!)\n\nThe main characters never &quot;take flight&quot; but that matters not at all. It&apos;s the simple story of the love between a man and his best friend that more than sufficiently works all the wonders. Not a sad one, but profoundly touching, So touching that even a tough guy like me couldn&apos;t possibly hold his tears.\n\nHachiko, the Akita dog, has set the Yardstick of loyalty under which all loyalty among us human beings are to be measured. Loyalty that is truly monumental. Loyalty that is to be surpassed only by God Himself.\n\nA must-watch film, especially for all dog lovers. Highly recommended for all families and people of all ages.",

            "reviewBody": "This movie came out in Turkey late 2005, without much advertising. It&apos;s a small family drama, set largely in western rural turkey in 1987. Within a couple of weeks, the film became a smash hit solely through word-of-mouth. Since then, it has received every national award and has become the third-biggest grossing film of the country&apos;s history by mid-March (it could go even higher, considering it&apos;s still playing in theaters after several months). It is indeed a good movie, but i doubt it&apos;ll reach the same kind of wide audiences outside the country. It&apos;s well-written, well-acted and well-shot; but some of the jokes, and especially the local accent that adds the movie a lot of its charm will be lost on international audiences i&apos;m afraid. Similarly, the film doesn&apos;t give much information about the political events that unfold in the background. I think one of the reasons the film did so well is that it reflects the atmosphere of the older Turkish films, from the industry&apos;s heyday in the sixties. Its mixture of comedy and tearjerker melodrama catches a very subtle balance. Granted, the melodrama bits are rather manipulative, but effective nonetheless. I heard that a tissue company did a campaign where they distributed tissues to the ingoing audiences, don&apos;t know if it&apos;s true though. My one (small) problem with the film is a few anachronistic details, but i guess they wouldn&apos;t even be noticed by someone who wasn&apos;t around then and there. If you come across this movie at a local festival or some other way (not very likely, but anyway), give it a shot. It&apos;s worth watching just to see the little kid in the leading role."

It&apos;s certainly visually and thematically rich and provocative as it slides between frequently explicit romance, comedy and horror: if in part it aims to shock, it certainly does so in style. However, I struggled to like any of the characters, all of whom seem as selfish and ruthless as each other, and felt no especial sympathy for the female leads simply because they happen to fall in love/list for each other. The film should perhaps be seen as a paean to desire, in all its oddness and intensity. But for all the artistry, I never quite escaped the feeling of a tale told by schoolchildren, snickering behind the bikesheds.",

            "reviewBody": "Comedies rarely stand the test of time - this one does: one of the funniest films I have ever seen.\n\nWhen I was 16 (20 years ago, sigh...), this was re-released for a short time in a local art-house cinema, and my father insisted I go watching it with a friend. Well, teenagers don&apos;t normally line up to see 50 year old black and white comedies, but - man, was I glad I did!\n\nThis is a pitch black comedy that feels as fresh today as it must have then; in fact, this must have been kind of a shock in 1942. There are no cheesy clean characters or cringe-worthy lines: this is a firework of fast, witty dialogue with an edge and the sexiest, cleverest (and most morally ambiguous) female protagonist I have ever seen in a film before the &quot;New Hollywod&quot; era.\n\nEven the structure and the way the story evolves are very modern; there are flashbacks and twists and turns that might be very common in contemporary films but must have seemed almost &quot;avant-garde&quot; at the time.\n\nThe biggest fun, of course, is how Lubitsch takes the pi** out of Hitler&apos;s blind, fanatic followers. I don&apos;t believe the Nazis have ever been mocked better than in this comedy masterpiece (and I only hope old Adolf has seen it, too). Mel Brooks&apos; remake is not bad, but the original is simply killer. \n\nSee it, and then see it again (and again).\n\nPriceless. 10 out of 10\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

I wasn&apos;t expecting it to be that good, but The Iron Giant was an amazing movie, it is easily the most exquisite animated movie I have ever seen.\n\nHogarth Hughes (Eli Marenthal) is obsessed by the opportunites offered by science fiction, the possibility of an alien take-over or, at the very least, an attack from outer space. The original story, which the late Poet Laureate had set in England, saw the innocent Titan of the title emerge from the sea; here he is a visitor from another galaxy.\n\nThe Iron Giant is an amazing piece of animation, the voice-overs were done perfectly, the actors obviously enjoyed themselves, the animated art direction and cinematography was beautiful and the giant itself is just...breathtaking.\n\nThe Iron Giant is not just another silly little kiddies movie, it is perfection in filmmaking. Please, for the love of God, make your life better and see this brilliant film.\n\nI rate The Iron Giant 10 out of 10."

The first time I saw it, I was a little put off by what I thought was a pompous disclaimer that &quot;not one foot&quot; of documentary footage had been used. But, in light of the finished product, it&apos;s a remarkable statement. If a film has better captured the harsh and ugly realities that are an inevitable part of a true revolutionary movement, I never saw it. It is greatly to its credit that one never gets a sense of &quot;good guys vs. bad guys&quot; here--only of people trapped in a truly impossible set of circumstances, from which no escape is possible without confrontation and bloodshed. It was depressing to see this movie in Berkeley in the early 70s, and hear the audience cheer the &quot;heroic&quot; Algerian revolutionaries while booing the &quot;villainous&quot; French, in view of the great pains that had been taken to present a balanced viewpoint. This film is thrilling, heartbreaking, thought-provoking, and beautiful--sometimes by turns and sometimes all at once. If you haven&apos;t seen it and it show up anywhere in the vicinityh, drop everything and go--and pray that it&apos;s subtitled and not dubbed. (There are dubbed prints and, as is usually the case, dubbing pretty nearly wrecks it.) This is a masterpiece."

            "reviewBody": "The sensitivity with which Krakauer captured the essence of McCandless and his adventure is extended aptly to the movie format by Sean Penn. Even if one might not be able to appreciate the purpose for Alex&apos;s journey, I don&apos;t think anyone would be able to deny that Into the Wild is a sensitive and poignant cinematic experience. There are scenes in this movie that one will never be able to forget, particularly the ending sequence. This movie will easily pull its audience into a philosophical debate for the truth about who was right and wrong isn&apos;t easy to distinguish. Sean Penn certainly doesn&apos;t try to answer those questions, questions that McCandless&apos; life left for his family and the rest of us. Penn does well to tread a delicate objective but not indifferent line. Certainly the best movie of this year and one of the best ever made. The story, the story itself is great.",

If you or I were escaping from prison, all the sounds Fontaine must pay attention to we must as well.\n\nI doubt you&apos;ll find this film at your local video store, but I encourage everyone to check it out.

I will tell a short version of my personal life to let you know how it affected me from my own experience of growing up in the Thirties\n\nI think their must have been more then one car because ours was full of stuff in the back seat, clear up almost to the roof. Frankie, Bill and me (my brothers) all was on top of the stuff in the back seat, had to stay lying down was not enough room to set up. What I remember most about the trip was it was awful hot when we went through Arizona and we had not much water, the water we had was in a canvas bag, hooked to the front bumper to help keep it cool. We did not get much because dad was saving it for the car when the car got to hot. Mom told us to suck on pebbles, and we did. It was a bad time every where. No jobs or anyway to make any money. \n\nWe were going to California because their was suppose to be some picking work their, after we got to California we saw miles of potatoes all loose piled up high my guess would be about six feet high, they had put lime or something that looked like lime it was a white powder to keep people from taking them to eat.\n\nWe found a place to pick plums that they used to make prunes and we lived in a Quonset hut made of corrugated metal setting on a concrete slab. The public toilets were near were we stayed, Joe and his wife (Family friends)had their own Hutthis was the time that dad &amp; Joe would sell tickets for people to watch them box each other in a ring at the recreation hall on the property. Also they joined a baseball team and played baseball, dad played left field. We got to watch them play for free.\n\nSeems like Frankie and I played together a lot don&apos;t think Bill did because he was still a baby his self, Doris and Dorothy (my sisters) was still crawling so Bill could not have been very old at that time. Frank &amp; I would go pick up plums off the ground and we would bring them home, Doris and Dorothy would set in the box and eat them. You can guess what they would look like when mom and dad got home, their was no air condition back then so they would take a hose and squirt water on the tin Quonset hut to try and cool it off some, I know when we went west we looked like those grapes of wrath folks in the movie.\n\nThat area was the first time I ever saw a frog walk, it was to hot for them to hop, when they tried to hop their bellies would touch the ground ( gravel) and would burn them, any way that&apos;s what we thought at that time. I saw the movie of Grapes of wrath a long time ago, and I remember it so well, I cried most of the time it was on because it reminded me of the hard time we all had back then, I was born in Oklahoma and it was just a terrible time in the late thirties I would love to see the movie again, its to me a history of my family, I am 71 1/2 years old now and still remember it very clearly.\n\nGene McDaniel",

            "reviewBody": "My brother told me that some people say &quot;ground hog&quot; day is one of the most spiritual movies ever made. First times I watched the movie ( I already have seen it a dozen times) I just laughed about it. But after some times watching I saw what the director wanted to say with it.\n\nIn my own life the same thing happened but not as heavy as in the movie. I mean, in my life the day just become another day. ( really I ask myself, the only thing that was different that was the date) I think a lot of people live in groundhog day, doing the same thing again and again, not taking the best out of life. Just living without any consciousness. Not having enough time by their own fault, because time is a thing you can offer yourself by making other choices.\n\nGroundhog day....I personally am getting rid of that day more and more fortunately and finally too. More and more I am trying to make best of life and using every day in another way. \n\nI am not crazy. No, I just watch movies with some kind of view lately. In every movie there is a hidden message told.\n\nEnough about Ground Hog day....I gave the movie an 8 because the number 8 is the number of eternity. And that&apos;s also a thing the movie is about. About eternity and not about the bad and boring repeating of the stupid livings.\n\nDanny",

            "reviewBody": "A young man gets into the world of illegal dog fighting in order to get enough money together to be able to run away with his brother&apos;s wife, but in the meantime he starts tension with another dog owner. A beautiful young model signs a lucrative contract with a perfume company and moves into her new flat with her lover  only for her tragedy to strike and her dog to go missing. Finally an ex-convict and guerrilla mourns the wife he left decades ago and longs to meet the daughter who thinks he is dead  but is also contracted to kill a businessman. These three lives come together in a car crash that acts as a catalyst in changing their lives.\n\nAfter seeing 21 Grams I knew that I had to get round to seeing this film. With it&apos;s appearance on TV (BBC4 showing itself to really be a &apos;place to think&apos; and a wonderful channel to have) I took the opportunity to watch it, expecting a film that would match the good things I had heard about it. &gt;From the opening car chase that results in the crash that the film spirals outwards from like debris, through for most of the first hour, I was hooked  the pace was great and the story gripping. It was violent, exciting and yet had a human element to it as well. However the second story knocked the wind out of it for a moment, and seemed to lack the emotion of the first. It was based around an urban myth of sorts and wasn&apos;t as good  even if it did pick up towards the end.\n\nThe third story saw it return to a much more involving story of pain and the grinding out of life (as in &apos;getting by&apos;). Maybe it was the rich lifestyles of the characters in story two that stopped me caring as much  I don&apos;t know but I know that the contrast between one &amp; two made it more obvious how much the pace had dropped  especially when we are left wanted to know what happened to the characters we had spent an hour getting to care about. Anyway, the third story is a satisfying ending to the film and drew me back in emotionally where the second story had cut me off by it&apos;s abrupt start. Story two finishes before story three begins, and therefore it was easier to move on.\n\nI think the problem with this film for me was not the fact that three stories were intermingled but that I didn&apos;t think they were actually mixed well  the way the film moves away from characters before concluding their section (eg Octavia), the way the stories are actually quite separate from one another, these things and other I felt weakened the films  although each story was strong on it&apos;s own I just felt that story 2 was such a change to the film that it hurt it.\n\nHowever, as a film debut this is an amazing piece of work and is relentlessly impressive. From the opening car chase to the dog fights to the silent pain of the model looking out where her image once hung  in all these different moments I thought he did a great job and visually the film was never dull once no matter if it was set in a penthouse flat or a basement of an old building with the blood of dead dogs. And while we&apos;re on the subject, at the time of release I heard critics say they walked out of the film, refusing to watch cruelty to animals even being simulated. I can see their point but also think that they missed the fact that the animals in the film are mostly loved (even if they mostly die!)  however it is love and compassion for other humans that the film shows the characters having difficulty with, and this is where the emotional impact of the film is  not in simulated dogfights, albeit very well simulated dogfights that are hard to hear even if they are mostly unseen.\n\nThe cast were all natural but I always find it hard to judge performances when they are not in English. Having said that, there were no bad performances in the whole thing  even if some have better material to work with than others. Of course I still think this is a director&apos;s film and the cast often take second place to the style and the feel of the film.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this film but don&apos;t believe it deserves to be considered one of the &apos;best films ever made&apos;! The opening hour is superb and it&apos;s pace is relentless (even in more sensitive moments) but the sudden stop the film makes when it changes to story two is too much to stand and really caused the film to stutter for me. It gets better and is fully back on track for story three but there are problems running all through the narrative. Even though it has a lower rating on IMDb at time of writing, I&apos;d still say that 21 Grams offer this same fragmented style but with a much more satisfying narrative. Regardless of my nit picking I still think this is a powerful film that makes 150 minutes fly by with a huge amount of style from the first-time director, even if it does not live up to the endlessly gushing praise lavished upon it by many viewers."

            "reviewBody": "I grew up in the 60&apos;s, the setting for The Help, a story of Southern prejudice and cruelty toward African Americans, who were chattel of the Southern rich treating their servants as expendable and marginal. I can say that as a Northerner with a black maid for our household, there was love but always a barrier, a carryover from the strict separation still prevailing after reconstruction.\n\nDirector Tate Taylor keeps the race relations taut but not strident, as if we were living through the emerging civil rights movement slowly but inevitably aimed at equality, not &quot;separate but equal.&quot; Skeeter (Emma Stone) graduates, returns to Jackson, Miss., and decides to write about the black help, whose &quot;perspective&apos; needs to be told. As more maids join in the writing of the manuscript, the more possible it is to counter the assassination of Medgar Evers and eventually that of Martin Luther King.\n\nWhile we have grown used to the base scatological humor of the Hangovers, Change-UP, and other rom-coms, the fundament motif in The Help is as low-key as will ever be depicted in film. Not only is the idea of the bad guys &quot;eating s—t&quot; effective, it is funny and poignant.\n\nA note about the performances—Bryce Dallas Howard as the conservative, prejudiced Hilly, is remarkably successful, making her a full-fledged actress and not just a famous director&apos;s daughter. Jessica Chastain as the ditzy but big-hearted Celia Foote cements her place as a great modern actress following her memorable role as the compliant wife in Tree of Life. Emma Stone no longer need rely on rom-coms, for she stars in The Help with a performance nuanced and underplayed, just the way I like it, albeit a bit too hip for the times.\n\nAlthough the film tends toward the simplistic, e.g., there are no bad blacks and most whites are obtuse, Viola Davis as maid Aibileen Clark successfully carries the film displaying the ambivalent nature of slavery ready to burst out of its chains."

            "reviewBody": "The only Alfred Hitchcock (Oscar-nominated for directing) film to win the Best Picture Oscar, &quot;Rebecca&quot; is one of those typical films from the amazing director that chills, entertains and puts you on the edge of your seat each time you watch it. Joan Fontaine (Oscar-nominated) has just married the very wealthy Laurence Olivier (also Oscar-nominated), but she is haunted by his mysterious housekeeper (a show-stopping Oscar-nominated performance by Judith Anderson) and the memory of the film&apos;s titled character (Olivier&apos;s late wife). Hitchcock, noted for his subtle sexual under-tones in films spares none of that here as Anderson&apos;s character and the late titled character&apos;s relationship seemed to go much further than employee-employer. Anderson slowly tries to drive Fontaine to insanity and the end she may accomplish her devious goal. Hitchcock&apos;s first real major U.S. debut stunned the Academy and audiences alike and would lead to the coveted Best Picture Oscar. It is not the best film the legendary director ever worked on, but it is still an amazingly good production that works on many cinematic levels. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

At times life affirming in its quieter moments, at other times shocking in its depiction of Japanese teen life.\n\nEgged on by his school mates, Shoya bullies the newly arrived Shoko, who happens to be deaf. Perceived to be receiving special treatment, and being different (a crime in Japanese society), Shoko is fair game for any number of cruelties. Until it goes too far.\n\nThis movie then takes a different approach. Instead of showing the bullied person&apos;s return to strength, it shows the traumatised bully (and his cohorts) as he seeks to recover from the horror he put Shoko through. You may balk at the thought, but the paths of Shoya and Shoko are explored in their later high school lives, both being treated sympathetically.\n\nThe animation is beautiful, the script manages to avoid typical Japanese cliche, and the story takes some shocking turns without relying on trite misery or emotional manipulation. If you miss Ghibli, give this a watch. You&apos;ll be happy to know the spirit of great Japanese animation lives on.",

Shriya Saran is good in looks n below average in acting.Both her daughters look convincing and act decently well.
